I hope that our few remaining friends
Give up on trying to save us
I hope we come up with a fail-safe plot
To piss off the dumb few that forgave us
I hope the fences we mended
Fall down beneath their own weight
And I hope we hang on past the last exit
I hope it's already too late
And I hope the junkyard a few blocks from here
Someday burns down
And I hope the rising black smoke carries me far away
And I never come back to this town again

In my life
I hope I lie, and tell everyone you were a good wife
And I hope you die
I hope we both die

I hope I cut myself shaving tomorrow
I hope it bleeds all day long
Our friends say it's darkest before the sun rises
We're pretty sure they're all wrong
I hope it stays dark forever
I hope the worst isn't over
And I hope you blink before I do
And I hope I never get sober

And I hope when you think of me years down the line
You can't find one good thing to say
And I'd hope that if I found the strength to walk out
You'd stay the hell out of my way

I am drowning
There is no sign of land
You are coming down with me
Hand in unlovable hand
And I hope you die
I hope we both die


I broke free on a Saturday morning
I put the pedal to the floor
Headed north on Mills Avenue
And listened to the engine roar

My broken house behind me and good things ahead
A girl named Cathy wants a little of my time
Six cylinders underneath the hood crashing and kicking
Ahaha! Listen to the engine whine
I am going to make it through this year if it kills me
I am going to make it through this year if it kills me

I played video games in a drunken haze
I was seventeen years young
Hurt my knuckles punching the machines
The taste of Scotch rich on my tongue

And then Cathy showed up and we hung out
Trading swigs from a bottle all bitter and clean
Locking eyes, holding hands
Twin high-maintenance machines

I am going to make it through this year if it kills me
I am going to make it through this year if it kills me

I drove home in the California dusk
I could feel the alcohol inside of me hum
Pictured the look on my stepfather's face
Ready for the bad things to come
I downshifted as I pulled into the driveway
The motor screaming out, stuck in second gear
The scene ends badly, as you might imagine
In a cavalcade of anger and fear
There will be feasting and dancing in Jerusalem next year

I am going to make it through this year if it kills me
I am going to make it through this year if it kills me


There's bound to be a ghost at the back of your closet
No matter where you live
There'll always be a few things, maybe several things
That you're going to find really difficult to forgive
There's gonna come a day when you feel better
You'll rise up free and easy on that day
And float from branch to branch
Lighter than the air
Just when that day is coming, who can say? Who can say?
Our mother has been absent ever since we founded Rome
But there's going to be a party when the wolf comes home

We're going to commandeer the local airwaves
To tell the neighbors what's been going on
And they will shake their heads and wag their bony fingers
In all the wrong directions
And by daybreak we'll be gone
I'm going to get myself in fighting trim
Scope out every angle of unfair advantage
I'm gonna bribe the officials
I'm gonna kill all the judges
It's going to take you people years to recover from all of the damage

Our mother has been absent ever since we founded Rome
But there's going to be a party when the wolf comes home


King Saul fell on his sword when it all went wrong
And Joseph's brothers sold him down the river for a song
And Sonny Liston rubbed some Tiger Balm into his glove
Some things you do for money and some you do for love love love

Raskolnikov felt sick but he couldn't say why
When he saw his face reflected in his victim's twinkling eye
Some things you'll do for money and some you'll do for fun
But the things you do for love are going to come back to you one by one
Love love is going to lead you by the hand
Into a white and soundless place
Now we see things as in a mirror dimly
Then we shall see each other face to face

And way out in Seattle, young Kurt Cobain
Snuck out to the greenhouse, put a bullet in his brain
Snakes in the grass beneath our feet, rain in the clouds above
Some moments last forever, but some flare out with love love love


From the ocean to the shore
The warning signs have all been bright and garish
Far too great in number to ignore
From the cities to the swamplands
From the highways to the hills
Our love has never had a leg to stand on
From the aspirins to the cross-tops to the Elavils
But I will walk down to the end with you
If you will come all the way down with me
From the entrance to the exit
Is longer than it looks from where we stand
I want to say I'm sorry for stuff I haven't done yet
Things will shortly get completely out of hand
I can feel it in the rotten air tonight
In the tips of my fingers, in the skin on my face
In the weak last gasp of the evening's dying light
In the way those eyes I've always loved illuminate this place
Like a trashcan fire in a prison cell
Like the searchlights in the parking lots of hell
I will walk down to the end with you
If you will come all the way down with me


The most remarkable thing about coming home to you
Is the feeling of being in motion again;
It's the most extraordinary thing in the world
I have two big hands
And a heart pumping blood
And a 1967 Colt .45 with a busted safety catch

The world shines
As I cross the Macon county line
Going to Georgia
The most remarkable thing about you standing in the doorway
Is that it's you and that you are standing in the doorway
And you smile as you ease the gun from my hand
I am frozen with joy right where I stand
The world throws its light underneath your hair
Forty miles from Atlanta
This is nowhere
Going to Georgia

The world shines
As I cross the Macon county line
Going to Georgia


Were a couple of guys who'd been friends since grade school
One was named Cyrus, and the other was Jeff
And they practiced twice a week in Jeff's bedroom
The best ever death metal band out of Denton
Never settled on a name
But the top three contenders, after weeks of debate
Were "Satan's Fingers," and "The Killers," and "The Hospital Bombers"
Jeff and Cyrus believed in their hearts they were headed
For stage lights and Lear jets, and fortune and fame
So in script that made prominent use of a pentagram
They stenciled their drumheads and guitars with their names
This was how Cyrus got sent to the school
Where they told him he'd never be famous
And this was why Jeff
In the letters he'd write to his friend
Helped develop a plan to get even
When you punish a person for dreaming his dream
Don't expect him to thank or forgive you
The best ever death metal band out of Denton
Will in time both outpace and outlive you
Hail Satan!
Hail Satan tonight!
Hail Satan!
Hail hail!


No one knows where the lone wolf sleeps
No one sees the hidden treasure in the castle keep
No one learns the secret name
No one burns in the absent flame
No one broke D.B. Cooper’s fall
No one hopes to hear the bagman call
Children piping in the main square
But no one’s dancing
No one’s dancing down there
The river goes where the water flows
But no one knows when the Batcave closed
The river goes where the water flows
But no one knows when the Batcave closed

No promise sweeter than a blood pact
Nothing harder to go through with than a vanishing act
No morning colder than the first frost
No friends closer than the ones we’ve lost
Nothing sharper than a serpent’s tooth
Nothing harder than the gospel truth
Though you repent and don sackcloth and try to make nice
You can’t cross the same river twice

The river goes where the water flows
But no one knows when the Batcave closed
The river goes where the water flows
But no one knows when the Batcave closed

There’s a club where you’d like to go
You could meet someone who’s lost like you
Revel in the darkness like a pair of open graves
Fumble through the fog for a season or two

No town more barren than our town
No haven safer than the one they tore down
No greater love than to lay my life down for a friend
No sweeter pleasure than to see the credits clear through to the end
No one knows where the lone wolf’s gone
No one sees it camped out right there on the front lawn
We played for you but you would not sing
No one was going to get away with anything

The river goes where the water flows
But no one knows when the Batcave closed
The river goes where the water flows
But no one knows when the Batcave closed


Born down in El Paso where the tumbleweeds blow
To the middleweight champ of all of Mexico
Dad fought many bloody battles, and he raised four sons
Chavo was the oldest one
Old man Gory could pop like a live grenade
Raised his boys in the way of the trade
Hector and Mando, young Eddie G
Chavo meant the most to me

Look high
It's my last hope
Chavo Guerrero
Coming off the top rope
He came from Texas seeking fortune and fame
Rose pretty quickly to the top of his game
Defender of the downtrodden, king of the hill
Tag-team champion with Al Madril
Before a black-and-white TV in the middle of the night
I'm lying on the floor, I'm bathed in blue light
The telecast's in Spanish, I can understand some
And I need justice in my life; here it comes

Look high
It's my last hope
Chavo Guerrero
Coming off the top rope

Red Shoes Dugan
Holding his arm high all out of breath
I hated all of Chavo's enemies
I would pray nightly for their death
Descending like fire
On the people who deserved it most
Almost completely unknown
Outside of Texas and on the West Coast

He was my hero back when I was a kid
You let me down, but Chavo never once did
You called him names to try to get beneath my skin
Now, your ashes are scattered on the wind
I heard his son got famous, he went nationwide
Coast-to-coast with his dad by his side
I don't know if that's true, but I've been told
It's real sweet to grow old

Look high
It's my last hope
Chavo Guerrero
Coming off the top rope


Get stomped like a snake
Lie down in the dirt
Cling to my convictions
Even when I get hurt
Be an upstanding, well-loved man about town
In your child’s mind, that’s how it goes down
But I tried the losing side

I don't want to die in here
I don't want to die in here
Drift down into the new, dark light
Without any reservations
You found my breaking point
Congratulations
Spent too much of my life now trying to play fair
Throw my better self overboard
Shoot at him when he comes up for air
Come unhinged, get revenge

I don't want to die in here
I don't want to die in here

Stay good under pressure
For years and years and years and years
President of the fan club
Up there choking on his tears

Let all the trash rain down
From way up in the rafters
I’m walking out of here in one piece
Don’t care what comes after
Drive the wedge, torch the bridge

I don't want to die in here
I don't want to die in here



I checked into a bargain-priced room on La Cienaga
Gazed out through the curtains at the parking lot
Walked down to the corner store just before nightfall in my bare feet
Black tarry asphalt, soft and hot
And when I came back, I spread out my supplies
On the counter by the sink, looked myself right in the eyes

St. Joseph's baby aspirin
Bartles and Jaymes
And you
Or your memory
I ducked behind the drapes when I saw the moon begin to rise
Gathered in my loose ends switched off the light
And down there in the dark I could see the real truth about me
As clear as day, Lord, if I make it through tonight
Then I will mend my ways
And walk the straight path to the end of my days

St. Joseph's baby aspirin
Bartles and Jaymes
And you
Or your memory


When I come home
Spittle bubbling on your lips
Fine white foam
I am young, and I am good
It's a hot southern California day
If I wake you up, there will be hell to pay
And alone in my room
I am the last of a lost civilization
And I vanish into the dark
And rise above my station
Rise above my station
But I do wake you up, and when I do
You blaze down the hall and you scream
I'm in my room with the headphones on
Deep in the dream chamber
And then I'm awake and I'm guarding my face
Hoping you don't break my stereo
Because it's the one thing that I couldn't live without
And so I think about that and then I sorta black out
Held under these smothering waves
By your strong and thick-veined hand
But one of these days I'm going to wriggle up on dry land


Of the near north side
Mount those bridge rails
Ride all night
Scream when captured
Arch your back
Let this whole town hear
Your knuckles crack
Sapphire Trans-Am
High beams in rain
Drive wild broncos
Down the plain
Push up to the corner
Where the turbines hiss
Someday we won't
Remember this
Crawl 'til dawn
On my hands and knees
God damn these vampires
For what they've done to me
Tie those horses
To the post outside
And let those glass doors
Open wide
And in their surface
See two young, savage things
Barely worth
Remembering
Feast like pagans
Never get enough
Sleep like dead men
Wake up like dead men
And when the sun comes
Try not to hate the light
Someday we'll try
To walk upright
Crawl 'til dawn
On my hands and knees
God damn these bite marks
Deep in my arteries
Crawl 'til dawn
On my hands and knees
God damn these vampires
For what they've done to me


This is a song with the same four chords
I use most of the time
When I've got something on my mind
And I don't want to squander the moment
Trying to come up with a better way
To say what I want to say

People were mean to you
But I always thought you were cool
Clicking down the concrete hallways
In your spiked heels
Back in high school
It's good to be young, but let's not kid ourselves
It's better to pass on through those years and come out the other side
With our hearts still beating
Having stared down demons
Come back breathing

People were mean to you
But I always thought you were cool
Clicking down the concrete hallways
In your spiked heels
Back in high school

You deserved better than you got
Someone's got to say it sometime because it's true
People should have told you you were awesome
Instead of taking advantage of you
I hope you love your life now, like I love mine
I hope the painful memories only flex their power over you a little of the time

We held on to hope of better days coming
And when we did we were right
I hope the people who did you wrong
Have trouble sleeping at night

People were mean to you
But I always thought you were cool
Clicking down the concrete hallways
In your spiked heels
Back in high school


How bad they'll make you feel
Sometimes you try to freeze time
'Til the slots are a blur of spinning wheels
But I am just a broken machine
And I do things that I don't really mean
Long, black night
Morning frost
I'm still here
But all is lost
Speed up to the precipice
And then slam on the brakes
Some people crash two or three times
And then learn from their mistakes
But we are the ones who don't slow down at all
And there's nobody there to catch us when we fall
Long, black night
Morning frost
I'm still here
But all is lost
Feel the storm every night
Hope it passes by
Hallucinate a shady grove
Where Judas went to die
Unfurl the black velvet altar-cloth
Draw a white-chalk Baphomet
Mistreat your altar boys long enough
And this is what you get
Sad and angry, can't learn how to behave
Still won't know how in the darkness of the grave
Long, black night
Morning frost
I'm still here
But all is lost


Alright, I'm on Johnson Avenue in San Luis Obispo
And I'm five years old, or six, maybe
And indications that there's something wrong with our new house
Trip down the wire twice daily

I'm in the living room watching the Watergate hearings
While my stepfather yells at my mother
Launches a glass across the room, straight at her head
And I dash upstairs to take cover
Lean in close to my little record player on the floor
So this is what the volume knob's for

I listen to dance music
Dance music

Okay, so look, I'm 17 years old
And you're the last best thing I've got going
But then the special secret sickness starts to eat through you
What am I supposed to do? No way of knowing

So I follow you down your twisting alleyways
Find a few cul-de-sacs of my own
There's only one place this road ever ends up
And I don't want to die alone

Let me down, let me down, let me down gently
When the police come to get me

I'm listening to dance music
Dance music



Ah the lengthening hours in the refinery
Belching fire into the sky
We do our best vampire routines
As we suck the dying hours dry
The night is lovely as a rose
If I see sunlight hit you
I am sure that we'll both decompose
Ah the fitful sleep and the fire engines
That I dream of when I dream
Some day we'll both wake up for good
I will try hard not to scream
The evening wind will shake the blinds
You're stirring from your slumber
We've got something hateful on our minds

Oh sing, sing, sing
For the dying of the day
Sing for the flames that will rip through here
And the smoke that will carry us away
Yeah sing for the damage we've done
And the worse things that we'll do
Open your mouth up and sing for me now
And I will sing for you



She came in on the red-eye to Dallas-Fort Worth
All the way from sunny Taipei
Skin the color of a walnut shell
And a baseball cap holding down her black hair
And she came here after midnight
The hot weather made her feel right at home

Come on in
We haven't slept for weeks
Drink some of this
It'll put color in your cheeks
He drove in from Mexicali, no worse for wear
Money to burn, time to kill
But five minutes looking in his eyes
And we all knew he was broken pretty bad, so we gave him what we had
We cleared a space for him to sleep in
And we let the silence that's our trademark make its presence felt

Come on in
We haven't slept for weeks
Drink some of this
It'll put color in your cheeks

They came in by the dozens, walking or crawling
Some were bright-eyed, some were dead on their feet
And they came from Zimbabwe, or from Soviet Georgia
East Saint Louis, or from Paris, or they lived across the street
But they came, and when they finally made it here
It was the least that we could do to make our welcome clear

Come on in
We haven't slept for weeks
Drink some of this
This'll put color in your cheeks


I was not there for rehearsal, I don’t need it any more
When I show up just in time to pop, you can clear the goddamn floor
Empty out the locker room, let me find my space
Let him who thinks he knows no fear look well upon my face

Nameless bodies in unremembered rooms
Know how a man becomes a beast when the wolfbane blooms

Sail past all the grasping hands, floodlights white and hot
Bring my vision into focus, find out what I’ve got
Some sniveling local babyface with an angle he can’t sell
Full werewolf off the buckle like an angel straight from hell
Nameless bodies in unremembered rooms
Run howling through the carnage when the wolfbane blooms

Half the city sound asleep and safe inside their beds
Get lost inside my thoughts and nearly tear his face to shreds
Blood pooling on the canvas as the atmosphere gets hushed
Bring your heroes to the wolf’s den, watch them all get crushed
Get told to maybe dial it back backstage later on
Everyone still in this building right now: dead before the dawn

Nameless bodies in unremembered rooms
The pure at heart go putrid when the wolfbane blooms


Hand me your hand, let me look in your eyes
As my last chance to feel human begins to vaporize
Maybe it's the heat in here, maybe it's the pressure
You ought to head for the exits, the sooner the better

I am this great, unstable mass of blood and foam
And no one in her right mind would make my home her home
My heart's an autoclave
My heart's an autoclave (x2)
When I try to open up to you I get completely lost
Houses swallowed by the earth, windows thick with frost
And I reach deep down within, but the pathways twist and turn
And there's no light anywhere, and nothing left to burn

And I am this great, unstable mass of blood and foam
And no emotion that's worth having could call my heart its home
My heart's an autoclave
My heart's an autoclave (x2)

I dreamt that I was perched atop a throne of human skulls
On a cliff above the ocean, howling wind and shrieking seagulls
And the dream went on forever, one single static frame
Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name

I am this great, unstable mass of blood and foam
And no one in her right mind would make her home my home
My heart's an autoclave
My heart's an autoclave (x2)


Whipped like a dog, down on the cards
Square in the spotlight sweating real hard
All soaked in blood like a newborn babe
Sharp thing hidden in my hand shaped like an astrolabe

Gonna stick you in the eye with a foreign object
Gonna poke you in the eye with a foreign object

March through the red mist, never get my vision clear
Learn to love this kind of atmosphere
Strike funny poses, keep my weapon hand low
Whip my head around a little, get blood on the front row
Gonna jab you in the eye with a foreign object
I personally will stab you in the eye with a foreign object
Foreign object, foreign object, foreign object

Sink my teeth into your scalp, take a nice big bite
Save nothing for the cameras, play the angles all night
One of these days my legs will both snap like twigs
If you can't beat ’em make 'em bleed like pigs

I'm gonna jab you in the eye with a foreign object
I'm gonna stab you in the eye with a foreign object

Ba, ba da da, ba ba ba da, foreign object
Ba, ba da da, ba ba ba da, foreign object
Ba, ba da da, ba ba ba da, foreign object


Our love gorges on the alcohol we feed it
And it grows all fat and friendly
We have surplus if we need it
We hold on as hard as we can
Our knuckles are white
We write letters to each other
Invent secrets to confess to
I learn foreign and exotic terms of endearment
By which to address you
We feed fresh fruit to one another
We stay up all night
I am healthy, I am whole
But I have poor impulse control
And I want to go home
But I am home
We are strong, we are faithful
We are guardians of a rare thing
We pay close, careful attention
To the news the morning air brings
We show great loyalty
To the hard times we've been through
We are filled with riches and wonders
Our love keeps the things it finds
And we dance like drunken sailors
Lost at sea, out of our minds
You find shelter somewhere in me
I find great comfort in you
And I keep you safe from harm
You hold me in your arms
And I want to go home
But I am home


Plums on the tree heavy with nectar
Prayers to summon the destroying angel
Moon stuttering in the sky like film stuck in a projector
And you
You
Twin prop airplanes passing loudly overhead
Road to the airport two lanes clear
Half the whole town gone for the summer
Terrible silence coming down here
And you
You
There is no deadline
There is no schedule
There is no plan we can fall back on
The road this far can't be retraced
There is no punchline anybody can tack on
There are loose ends by the score
What did I come down here for?
You
You


The reception's gotten fuzzy
The delicate balance has shifted
Put on your gloves and your black pumps
Let's pretend the fog has lifted

Now you see me
Now you don't
Now you say you love me
Pretty soon you won't
If we get our full three-score and ten
We won't pass this way again
So kiss me with your mouth open
Turn the tires toward the street
And stay sweet

All the chickens coming home to roost
Plump bodies blotting out the sky
You know it breaks my heart in half, in half
When I see them trying to fly
'Cause you just can't do
Things your body wasn't meant to
Hike up your fishnets
I know you

If we live to see the other side of this
I will remember your kiss
So do it with your mouth open
And take your foot off of the brake
For Christ's sake!


They'd hooked you up to a fentanyl drip
To mitigate the pain a little bit
I flew in from Pennsylvania
When I heard the hour was coming fast
And I docked in Santa Barbara
Tried to brace myself
But you can't brace yourself when the time comes
You just have to roll with the blast

And I'm an eighteen wheeler headed down the interstate
And my brakes are going to give and I won't know until it's too late
Tires screaming when I lose control
Try not to hurt too many people when I roll
Find the Harbor Freeway and head south
Real tired, head kind of light
I found Telegraph Road, I'd only seen the name on envelopes
Found the parking lot and turned right
I felt all the details carving out space in my head
Tropicana's on the walkway, neon red
Between the pain and the pills trying to hold it at bay
Stands a traveler going somewhere far away

And I am an airplane tumbling wing over wing
Tried to listen to my instruments, they don't say anything
People screaming when the engines quit
I hope we're all in crash position when we hit

And then came to your bedside
And as it turns out, I'm not ready
And as though you were speaking through a thick haze
You said hello to me
We all stood there around you
Happy to hear you speak
The last of something bright burning, still burning
Beyond the cancer and the chemotherapy

And you were a presence full of light upon this earth
And I am a witness to your life and to its worth
It's three days later when I get the call
And there's nobody around to break my fall


Do every stupid thing that makes you feel alive
Do every stupid thing to try to drive the dark away
Let people call you crazy for the choices that you make
Climb limits past the limits, jump in front of trains all day

And stay alive
Just stay alive

Play with matches if you think you need to play with matches
Seek out the hidden places where the fire burns hot and bright
Find where the heat's unbearable and stay there if you have to
Don't hurt anybody on your way up to the light
And stay alive
Just stay alive

People might laugh at your tattoos
When they do, get new ones in completely garish hues

I hide down in my corner, because I like my corner
I am happy where the vermin play
Make up magic spells; we wear them like protective shells
Landmines on the battlefield; find the one safe way

And stay alive
Just stay alive
Just stay alive


And they drag my body through the streets
And the sun's so hot I think I'll catch fire and burn up
In the summer air so moist and sweet
And the people all come out to cheer
Rocks in the pathway break my skin
And there's honeysuckle on the faint breeze today
With every breath I'm drawing in
I want to cry out
But I don't scream and I don't shout
And I feel so proud to be alive
And I feel so proud when the reckoning arrives
Crowds grow denser by the second
As we near the center of the town
And they dig a trench right in the main square right there
And they pick me up and throw me down
And I start laughing like a child
And I mark their faces one by one
Transfiguration's gonna come for me at last
And I will burn hotter than the sun
I waited so long and now I taste jasmine on my tongue
And I feel so proud to be alive
And I feel so proud when the reckoning arrives


Got up before dawn
Went down to the racetrack
Riding with the windows down
Shortly after your first heart attack
You parked behind the paddock
Cracking asphalt underfoot
Coming up through the cracks

Pale green things
Pale green things
You watched the horses run their workouts
You held your stopwatch in your left hand
And a Racing Form beneath your arm
Casting your gaze way out to no man's land
Sometimes I'll meet you out there
Lonely and frightened
Flicking my tongue out at the wet leaves

Pale green things
Pale green things

My sister called at 3 AM
Just last December
She told me how you'd died at last
At last
That morning at the racetrack
Was one thing I remembered
I turned it over in my mind
Like a living Chinese finger trap
Seaweed in Indiana sawgrass

Pale green things
Pale green things


There's indifference on the wind
But a faint gust of hope
At a club nobody goes to
With a musty velvet rope
Guys in Motörhead jackets
Who knew him way back when
Haven't raised a drink in years
But now meet up again
To remember how it was
When they all thought they'd move away
And ride in Lotus 7s
Through the London streets one day
Nobody ever gets away
Even the best of us come back some day
To the unmarked rooms, where the dry dust breeds
Andrew Eldritch is moving back to Leeds

There's a rusted fog machine
In a concrete storage space
Letter-number combinations
With no meaning on its face
They won't make these anymore
It's a wooden coach-and-four
No-one will even steal it
If you leave it by the door
No sign to mark it's going
No tombstone for its grave
There will be goodbyes by dozens
So practice being brave

No-one anticipates the rush
The breezy feeling of the faceless crush
At the end of things, where the selvage bleeds
Andrew Eldritch is moving back to Leeds

They don't throw him a parade
He just comes in on a train
One suitcase in his hand
And an old army backpack
From the second world war
From a Leipzig secondhand store

Pick the keys up from the agent
Everything's been taken care of
No big changes in the roadways
Since you've left that I'm aware of
A few old buildings gone to dust
And some new ones in the way
They'll look just like the old ones
When the winds have had their say
See the children bound for London
You'll all be back too
Everybody tests the membrane
But no-one pushes through

Come on boys that'll be enough
You'd think your old friends wouldn't play so tough
Like a basket by the Nile, hiding down among the reeds
Andrew Eldritch is moving back to Leeds


Was asleep in his car
When your chances fall in your lap like that
You gotta recognize them for what they really are
Nobody in this house
Wants to own up to the truth
I crawl in shotgun and reach into his mouth
And grab hold of one long, sharp tooth
And hold on
For dear life, I hold on
Well of course he wakes up
His paw hits the horn
I am going to regret
The day that I was born
And then mom
Rushes out to the driveway
My sister too
Everyone screaming
I am dreaming of you
I hold on
For dear life, I hold on
And my arms get sore
And my palms start to sweat
And the tears roll down my face
Till my cheeks are hot and red and soaking wet
In come the cops
They blow torch the doors
I start wailing
The lion roars
There's no good way to end this
Anyone can see
There's this great big you
And little old me
And we hold on
For dear life, we hold on
We hold on


Who hurled themselves in to the ocean
When they saw that the explosives in the cargo hold
Were just about to blow
This song is for the soil
That's toxic clear down to the bedrock
Where no thing of consequence can grow
Drop your seeds there
Let them go
Let them all go
Let 'em all go
This song is for the people
Who tell their families that they're sorry
For things they can't and won't feel sorry for
And once there was a desk
And now it's in a storage locker somewhere
And this song is for the stick pins and the cottons
I left in the top drawer
Let 'em all go
Let 'em all go
I wanna sing one for the cars
That are right now headed silent down the highway
And it's dark and there is nobody driving
And something has got to give
I saw you waiting by the roadside
You didn't know that I was watching
Now you know
Let it all go
Let 'em all go
Let it all go


Fog lifts from the harbor, dawn goes down to day
An agent crests the shadows of the nearby alleyway
Piles of broken bricks, sign posts on the path
Every moment points towards the aftermath
Yeah ah ah

Sailors straggle back from their nights out on the town
Hopeless urchins from the city gather around
Spies from imperial China wash in with the tide
Every battle heads toward surrender on both sides
And I am coming home to you
With my own blood in my mouth
And I am coming home to you
If it’s the last thing that I do

Bells ring in the tower, wolves howl in the hills
Chalk marks show up on a few high windowsills
And a rabbit gives up somewhere, and a dozen hawks descend
Every moment leads toward its own sad end
Yeah ah ah

Ships loosed from their moorings capsize and then they’re gone
Sailors with no captains watch awhile and then move on
And an agent crests the shadows and I head in her direction
All roads lead toward the same blocked intersection

I am coming home to you
With my own blood in my mouth
And I am coming home to you
If it’s the last thing that I do


There's only friendly fields and open roads
And you'll sleep better when you think
You've stepped back from the brink
And found some peace inside yourself
Laid down your heavy load
It gets all right to dream at night
Believe in solid skies and slate-blue earth below
But when you see him, you'll know
It's okay to find the faith to saunter forward
With no fear of shadows spreading where you stand
And you'll breathe easier just knowing
That the worst is all behind you
And the waves that tossed the raft all night
Have set you on dry land
It gets okay to praise the day
Believe in sheltering skies and stable earth beneath
But hear his breath come through his teeth
Walk by faith
Tell no one what you've seen
It's so good to learn that from right here
The view goes on forever
And you'll never want for comfort
And you'll never be alone
See the sunset turning red
Let all be quiet in your head
And look about—all the stars are coming out
They shine like steel swords
Wish me well where I go
But when you see me, you'll know


On the morning when I woke up without you for the first time
I felt free, and I felt lonely, and I felt scared
And I began to talk to myself almost immediately
Not being used to being the only person there
Hmmmm

The first time I made coffee for just myself
I made too much of it, but I drank it all
Just cause you hate it when I let things go to waste
And I wandered through the house, like a little boy lost at the mall
And an astronaut could've seen the hunger in my eyes from space
And I sang oh
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do without you?

On the morning when I woke up without you for the first time
I was cold, so I put on a sweater
And I turned up the heat
And the walls began to close in
And I felt so sad and frightened
I practically ran from the living room out into the street
And the wind began to blow and all the trees began to bend
And the world in its cold way started coming alive
And I stood there like a businessman waiting for a train
And I got ready for the future to arrive

And I sang oh
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do without you?


Pulled off the highway in Missouri
And lo, our hearts were heavy laden
Made for the chapel with some spray-paint
For all the things we'd held in secret
Lord, lift up these lifeless bones
Light cascading through the windows
All the rainbow's heavy tones

He has fixed his sign in the sky
He has raised me from the pit and set me high
Left that place in ruin
Drunk on the spirit and high on fumes
Checked into a Red Roof Inn
Stayed up for several hours and then slept like infants
In the burning fuselage of my days
Let my mouth be ever fresh with praise

He has fixed his sign in the sky
He has raised me from the pit and set me high

Each morning new
Each day shot through
With all the sharp, small shards of shrapnel
That seem to burst out of me and you

Head down toward Kansas
We will get there when we get there, don't you worry
Feel bad about the things we do along the way
But not really that bad
We inhaled the frozen air
Lord, send me a mechanic if I'm not beyond repair

He has fixed his sign in the sky
He has raised from the pit and he will set me high


'36 Hudson in the garage
All sorts of junk in the unattached spare room
Dishes in the kitchen sink
New straw for the old broom

Friends who don't have a clue
Well-meaning teachers
But down in your arms, in your arms
I am a wild creature
Floor two-foot high with newspapers
White carpet thick with pet hair
Half-eaten gallons of ice cream in the freezer
Fresh fuel for the sodium flares

I write down good reasons to freeze to death
In my spiral ring notebook
But in the long tresses of your hair
I am a babbling brook


You rushed for an average of eight and a third yards per carry
All eyes were on you
Junior year
Blew your knee out at an out-of-town game
Nowhere to go but down, down, down
Nothing but the ground left for you to fall to
By July
You'd made a whole bunch of brand new friends
People you used to look down on,
And you'd figured out a way to make real money
Giving ends to your friends and it felt stupendous,
Chrome spokes on your Japanese bike
But selling acid was a bad idea
And selling it to a cop was a worse one
The new laws said that seventeen-year-olds could do federal time
And you were the first one
So I sing this song for you
William Staniforth Donahue,
Your grandfather rode the boat over from Ireland
But you made a bad decision or two, yeah


Well, guy in a skeleton costume
Comes up to the guy in the Superman suit
Runs through him with a broadsword

I flip the television off
Bring all the bright lights up
Turn the radio up loud
I don't know why I'm so persuaded
That if I think things through
Long enough and hard enough
I'll somehow get to you
But then you came in
And we locked eyes
You kicked the ashtray over as we came toward each other
Stubbed my cigarette out against the west wall
Quickly lit another

Look at that
Would you look at that
We're throwing off sparks
What will I do when I don't have you to hold onto in the dark?

Yes, everybody's gonna need a witness
Everybody's gonna need a little backup in case the scene gets nasty
You throw the attic window open
And I throw myself all around you
And night comes to Tallahassee
I don't know why it's gotten harder
To keep myself away
I thought I'd finally beat the feeling back
It all came back today
And then we fell down
And we locked arms
We knocked the dresser over as we rolled across the floor
I don't mean it when I tell you
That I don't love you anymore

Look at that
Would you look at that
The way the ceiling starts to swerve
What will I do when I don't have you
When I finally get what I deserve


Crank that siren high
Drain the wellspring dry
Map out your coordinates
Send out scouts by day
Dole out mercenary pay
For restless young subordinates
It never hurts to give thanks to the local gods
You never know who might be hungry
It never hurts to scan the windows on the upper floor
I saw a face there once before when I was younger
Set the torch aflame
Call the night by name
Stake out your dark position
Lie in wait
By the gleaming city gate
Try not to lose sight of the mission
It never hurts to give thanks to the broken bones
You had to use to build your ladder

Moment close at hand
Half of you will never understand
And it doesn't really matter
Big smile on my face
Capsule just in case
Underneath my tongue there
Voices on the breeze
I heard voices once like these when I was younger

Blood rushing to my face
I know that sweet warm taste
And the bitter trace

Storm right down that hill
If I don’t, no one will
Follow me right through the chaos
This whole house is doomed
Even the bit-parts get consumed
Prepare a grave for Menelaus
It never hurts to give thanks to the navigator
Even when he's spitting out random numbers
I knew what those figures meant
And what they hoped to represent
When I was younger



When the radiator burst
I was three sheets to the wind
A civilian saw me first
And then there was the cop
And then the children standing on the corner
Your love is like a cyclone in a swamp
And the weather's getting warmer
I was getting out of jail
Heading to the Greyhound
You said you'd hop on one yourself
And meet me on the way down
I was shaking way too hard to think
Dead on my feet about to drop
Went and got the case of vodka from a car
And walked the two miles to the bus stop
Got on the bus half drunk again
The driver glared at me
Met up with you in Inglis
Thumbed a ride to Cedar Key
If we never make it back to California
I want you to know I love ya
But my love is like a dark cloud full of rain
That's always right there up above you
Hey!


We took a weekend, drove to Provo
The snow was white and fluffy
A weekend in Utah won't fix what's wrong with us
The gray sky was vast and real cryptic above me

I wanted you
To love me like you used to do

We took two weeks in the Bahamas
Went out dancing every night
Tried to fight the creeping sense of dread with temporal things
Most of the time I guess I felt alright
But I wanted you
To love me like you used to do

But you cannot run
And you cannot hide
From the wreck we've made of our house
From the mess inside

We went down to New Orleans
One weekend in the spring
Looked hard for what we'd lost
It was painful to admit it but we couldn't find a thing

I wanted you
To love me like you used to do

We went to New York City in September
Took the train out of Manhattan to the Grand Army stop
Found that bench we'd sat together on a thousand years ago
When I felt such love for you I thought my heart was gonna pop

I wanted you
To love me like you used to do

But I cannot run
And I can't hide
From the wreck we've made of our house
From the mess inside


Of our southwestern ranch-style house
On a new Kawasaki
All yellow and black
Fresh out of the showroom
Our house faced west
So the big orange sun
Positioned at your back
Lit up your magnificent silhouette
How much better, how much better can my life get?
900 cubic centimeters of raw, whining power
No outstanding warrants for my arrest
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
The pirate's life for me
I hopped on the back of the bike
Wrapped my arms around you
And I sank my face into your hair
And then I inhaled as deeply as I possibly could
You were as sweet and delicious as the warm desert air
And you pointed your headlamp toward the horizon
We were the one thing in the galaxy
God didn't have his eyes on
900 cc's of raw, whining power
No outstanding warrants for my arrest
Hi diddle dee dee, goddamn
The pirate's life for me


My love is like a powder keg
In the corner of an empty warehouse
Somewhere just outside of town
About to burn down
My love is like a Cuban plane
My love is like a Cuban plane
Flying from Havana
Up the Florida coast to the 'Glades
Soviet made
Our love is like the border between Greece and Albania
Our love is like the border between Greece and Albania
Trucks loaded down with weapons
Crossing over every night
Moon yellow and bright
There is a shortage in the blood supply
But there is no shortage of blood
The way I feel about you baby can't explain it
You got the best of my love


Holt Boulevard
Between Garey and White
Hooked up with some friends at the Travelodge
Set ourselves up for the night
Carpenter ants in the dresser
Flies in the screen
It will be too late by the time we learn
What these cryptic symbols mean

And I dreamt of a house
Haunted by all you tweakers with your hands out
And the headstones climbed up the hills
Send somebody out for soda
Comb through the carpet for clues
Reflective tape on our sweatpants
Big holes in our shoes
Every couple minutes
Someone says he can't stand it anymore
Laugh lines on our faces
Scale maps of the ocean floor

And I dreamt of a camera
Pointed out from inside the television
And the aperture yawning and blinking
And the headstones climbed up the hills

If anybody comes to see me
Tell them they just missed me by a minute
If anybody comes into our room while we're asleep
I hope they incinerate everybody in it

And I dreamt of a factory
Where they manufacture what I needed
Using shiny new machines
And the headstones climbed up the hills


Scratch at the chain links, maybe bare my teeth for show
Fed twice a day, I don't go hungry anymore
Feel in my bones just what the future has in store
I pace in circles
So the camera will see
Look hard at my stripes
There'll be no more after me
Laze by the shoreline while the sailors disembark
Scratch out a place to sit and rest down in the dark
Smell something burning downwind just a little ways
They set up camp and sing and sweat and work for days
I have no fear of anyone
I'm dumb and wild and free
I am a flightless bird
And there'll be no more after me
In Costa Rica, in a burrow underground
Climb to the surface, blink my eyes and look around
I'm all alone here as I try my tiny song
Claim my place beneath the sky, but I won't be here for long
I sang all night
The moon shone on me through the trees
No brothers left
And there'll be no more after me


Bad luck comes in from Tampa
On the back of a truck
Doing ninety up the interstate
We have bad dreams the night he rolls in
We have bad dreams the night he rolls in
And we try to keep our spirits high
But they flag and they wane
When the truck pulls up out front
In the light spring rain
And they sag like withering flowers
Let the good times roll on
Through these first few desperate hours
Yeah the driver drops his cargo at the curb
The driver drops his cargo at the curb
And the sun peeks in
Like a killer through the curtain
And when cloven hoof prints turn up in the garden
Yeah when cloven hoof prints turn up in the garden
We keep up the good fight
We keep our spirits light
But they drop like flies
And there's a stomach-churning shift
In the way the land lies
And they lean like towers
On a hillside struggling to stand
Through these first few desperate hours
Yeah


After one long season of waiting
After one long season of wanting
I am breaking open
My insides are pink and raw
And it hurts me when I move my jaw
But I am taking tiny steps forward

And I feel sure that my wounds will heal
And I will bloom here in my room
With a little water and a little bit of sunlight
And a little bit of tender mercy, tender mercy


The big trucks come up the highway
And the big wheels rattle my windows
And night, night comes to Texas
After one blind season alone in here
After one long, sweltering summer
I, I'm going to find the exit

And I will go to the house of a friend I know
And I will let myself forget

With a little water and a little bit of sunlight
And a little bit of tender mercy, tender mercy



Once a week I make the drive, two hours east
To check the Austin post office box
And I make the detour through our old neighborhood
See all the Chevy Impalas in their front yards up on blocks
And I park in an alley
And I read through the postcards you continue to send
Where as indirectly as you can, you ask what I remember
I like these torture devices from my old best friend
Well, I'll tell you what I know, like I swore I always would
I don't think it's gonna do you any good
I remember the train headed south out of Bangkok
Down toward the water

I always get a late start when the sun's going down
And the traffic's thinning out and the glare is hard to take
I wish the West Texas Highway was a Möbius strip
I could ride it out forever
When I feel my heart break
I almost swear I hear it happen, it's that clear and that hard
I come in off the highway and I park in my front yard
Fall out of the car like a hostage from a plane
Think of you a while, start wishing it would rain

I remember the train headed south out of Bangkok
Down toward the water

I come into the house, put on a pot of coffee
Walk the floors a little while
I set your postcard on the table with all the others like it
I start sorting through the pile
I check the pictures and the postmarks and the captions and the stamps
For signs of any pattern at all
When I come up empty-handed the feeling almost overwhelms me
I let a few of my defenses fall
And I smile a bitter smile, it's not a pretty thing to see
I think about a railroad platform back in 1983

I remember the train headed south out of Bangkok
Down toward the water


Hello there, Paul!
I had a take and I listened to it
And I was ready to send it and I thought:
You know? It can be done better
So here it is, then
Now I'm wearing my boots
Which always guarantees a good showing

You must try to lead a good life
You must do unto others as you would have them do
So that when you die, you'll find Golden Boy peanuts
Waiting in the afterlife for you
There are no pan-Asian supermarkets down in hell
So you can't buy Golden Boy peanuts
There are no pan-Asian supermarkets down in hell
So you can't buy Golden Boy peanuts

If thine enemy oppresseth you
You must let him oppress you some more
So that when you go shopping in paradise
You'll find those magnificent peanuts from Singapore
With the drawing of the young Chinese farmer
The eastern sun behind him smiling at you from the shelves
If we want to spend eternity in happiness
Well we're gonna have watch ourselves
You must give to the March of Dimes
You must be on guard against wickedness at all times
And you will find that your efforts have brought you great joy
When your spirit is munching on that Golden Boy

There are no pan-Asian supermarkets down in hell
So you can't buy Golden Boy peanuts there
But the streets of heaven are lined with shells
And there's billboards of the Golden Boy everywhere

There are no pan-Asian supermarkets down in hell
So you can't buy Golden Boy peanuts
There are no pan-Asian supermarkets down in hell
So you can't buy Golden Boy peanuts... GO!


Masks hanging on the tomb walls
Where the coven grieves
Witches hiding in the brambles
Ground level down where the dry leaves
Blow, and burn slowly
No ground is ever gonna hold me
White candles in the manor, where the curse takes hold
Bodies reassembling down where the worms crawl
Make your own friends when the world's gone cold
It gets dark and then
I feel certain I am going to rise again
If not by faith then by the sword
I'm going to be restored

Build fires to keep the beacon flashing
Where the earth lies flat
Blood calls to blood as the hours draw down
Invent my own family if it comes to that
Hold them close, hold them near
Tell them no one's ever going to hurt them here
Steal the treasure and try to leave town
Fight my way back down, don't want to hurt anyone
Probably gonna have to before it's all done

Take to the hills, run away
I'm gonna get my perfect body back someday
If not by faith then by the sword
I'm going to be restored


The men were here to get your Belgian things
They'll store them for you in an airplane hangar
There's guys in biohazard suits
Mud caking on their rubber boots
They've come to keep your pretty things from danger

The men were here to get your Belgian things
They'll spend the whole day hauling them downstairs
I shot a roll of thirty-two exposures
My camera groans beneath the weight it bears
I can see you in my sleep
Playing the points for all you're worth
Walking gingerly across the
Bruised earth

The men were here to get your Belgian things
They waltzed right through the door and went fluorescent
Their boots were black and shiny and your treasures gleamed like stars
Bones from deep down in the fertile crescent

The arteries are clogging in the mainframe
There's too much information in the pipes
I saw the mess you left up in the east bedroom
A tiger's never gonna change its stripes

I guess
I guess but Jesus what a mess
One way in and no way out

The men were here to get your Belgian things
And only I was here to see them do it
I wish you had a number where you are
It's hard with no one here to help me through it

I can see you in my sleep
Playing the points for all you're worth
Walking gingerly across the bruised earth


But everybody is out here on the streets
Somebody's opened up a fire hydrant
Cold water rushing out in sheets
Some kid in a Marcus Allen jersey
Asks me for a cigarette
Companionship is where you find it
So I take what I can get
Hubcaps on the cars like fun house mirrors
Stick to the shadows when I can
Lovecraft in Brooklyn
When the sun goes down the armies of the voiceless
Several hundred-thousand strong
Come out without their bandages
Their voices raised in song
And when the street lights sputter out
They make this awful sizzling sound
I cast my gaze toward the pavement
Too many blood stains on the ground
Rhode Island drops into the ocean
No place to call home anymore
Lovecraft in Brooklyn
Head outside most everyday
To try to keep the wolves away
Imagine nice things I might say
If company should come
Woke up afraid of my own shadow
Like, genuinely afraid
Headed for the pawnshop
To buy myself a switchblade
Someday something's coming
From way out beyond the stars
To kill us while we stand here
It'll store our brains in Mason jars
And then the girl behind the counter
She asks me how I feel today
I feel like Lovecraft in Brooklyn
Yeah


Small screen, July evening view
Up and down Grand Avenue
Where the legends get made
Out with the Boys' Brigade
Part of the motorcade

Flew home from Texas last night
Slept on the flight
Work like a dog all day
Born to chase cars away
Die on the road someday
I try to remember what life was like long ago
But it's gone, you know

Climb the turnbuckle high
Take two falls out of three
Blackout for local TV

Stand in that cold empty hall
Wait for your name to get called
Burn like hillsides on fire
In the squall of the ringside choir
High as a wire

Nearly drive Danny's nose back into his brain
All the cheap seats go insane
Keep my eyes open and try to think straight
No one drives on the 60 this late
Feel like the last person alive
Francisquito to Glenshaw Drive

I try to remember to write in the diary
That my son gave me

Climb the turnbuckle high
Take two falls out of three
Blackout for local TV


I'll drink to your health and you drink to mine
As we try
To make the money we scored out in Vegas hold out for a while
We drink vodka from Russia
We got our chocolates from Belgium
We have our strawberries flown in from England
But none of the money we spend
Seems to do us much good in the end
I got a cracked engine block, both of us do
Yeah, the house and the jewels, the Italian racecar
They don't make us feel better about who we are
I got termites in the framework, so do you
Down here where the watermelon grows so sweet
Where I worship the ground underneath of your feet
We are experts in the art of frivolous spending
It's gone on like this for three years I guess
And we're drunk all the time and our lives are a mess
And the deathless love we swore to protect with our bodies
Is stumbling across its bleak ending
But none of the rage in our eyes
Seems to finish it off where it lies
I got sugar in the fuel lines, both of us do
All the fights and the lies that we both love to tell
Fail to send our love to its reward down in hell
I got pudding for a backbone but so do you
La la la La, hey hey


All reserves completely spent
Someone set up the oxygen tent
Everybody here's real proud to present
Choked out
Two hundred dollar take-all purse
Half-nelson to suplex reverse
Worried look on the face of the ringside nurse
At one, for once, with the universe
Choked out
Choked out
Choked out
Choked out
I stretch and strain with all my might
Drift off into the velvety arms of the night
Kick and claw and scratch and bite
Fire up the grill, everybody eats tonight
Choked out
No brakes down, an endless dark incline
Most of the boys won't ever cross this line
If they all want to die dead broke that's fine, that's fine
Everybody's got their limits, nobody's found mine
Crowd screaming like hounds at the heat of the chase
All the colors of the rainbow flood my face
I lift right off into space
I can see the future, it's a real dark place
Choked out
Choked out
Choked out
Choked out
Choked out
Choked out


Crawling in the Colosseum dust
Who can count on his remaining limbs
All the people he can trust
Like the one who stands behind him
Cheering him on
Ecstatic when he stands defiant
Wild with abandon when he's gone
Just stay alive
Keep your eyes on the pay line
Like a village on the steppe
About to get collectivized
When the men emerge with rifles from the haystack
Everybody looks surprised
Like the mice in the forgotten grain
Way up on the top shelf
Like someone who's found a small town to escape to
Keeps one eye on his abandoned, former self
Stay in the game
Just try to play through the pain
Like a fighter who's been told it's finally time for him to quit
Show up in shining colours
And then stand there and get hit
Like the clock that ticks in Dresden
When the whole town's been destroyed
Like the nagging flash of insight
You're always desperate to avoid
Like the bloody-knuckled gunman
Still stationed at the breach
Like that board game with the sliders
And the children on the beach
Stay alive
Maybe spit blood at the camera
Just stay alive
Stay forever alive


Spring rain was misting down on Kingston
And down at the harbor
Local cops were intercepting an inbound shipment
And for a while there it was chaos
As they handcuffed and then roughed up some sailors
On the day my lung collapses
It's not going to be much different
On the day that Dennis Brown's habits caught up with him
School children sang in choirs
And out behind the Chinese restaurants
Guys were jumping into dumpsters
And the stench was overbearing
But they were past the point of caring
On the day my habits catch up with me
I'll be down among the jumpers
And when the birds come home in spring
We will fill them full of buckshot
And jets of contaminated blood
Will cloud the rivers and the lakes
It took all the coke in town
To bring down Dennis Brown
On the day my lung collapses
We'll see just how much it takes


Drawn to the dark
Covered by the blood when possible
Call to the corners
To any open crucible
Easy to reach
Bearing every mark unmissably
Wanna leave behind some token of what I carried with me
Search in the storm drains
Sleep in the underpasses
Try hard to look hard
Behind my blackout sunglasses
But I have high unicorn tolerance
I have high unicorn tolerance
I have high unicorn tolerance
I have high unicorn tolerance

Swim with real sharks
Those who never speak when spoken to
Hard limits fade into memory
Once broken through
Scaling the well
Every single day instinctively
Feel shame real shame
For what my friends must think of me
Dig through the graveyard
Rub the bones against my face
It gets real nice around the graveyard
Once you've acquired the taste
And when the clouds do clear away
Get a momentary chance to see
The thing I've been trying to beat to death
The soft creature that I used to be
The better animal I used to be
Draw where I'm drawn
Seldom wonder why, just follow you
Never blame the rags that swallowed me
For the place the river took me to
Long life to the spiders
Safe travels to the crows
Love to the ghosts
Who taught me everything I know

But I have high unicorn tolerance
I have high unicorn tolerance
But I have high unicorn tolerance
I have high unicorn tolerance4


You've got whatever's left of me to get
Our conversations are like minefields
No one's found a safe way through one yet
I spend a lot of money
I buy you white gold
We raise up a little roof
Against the cold
On Southwood Plantation Road
Where at night the stars blow like milk across the sky
Where the high wires drop
Where the fat crows fly
All night long you giggle and scream
Your brown eyes deeper than a dream
I am not going to lose you
We are going to stay married
In this house like a Louisiana graveyard
Where nothing stays buried
On Southwood Plantation Road
Where the dead will walk again
Put on their Sunday best
And mingle with unsuspecting Christian men
La la la la la


No one anticipates the sunset flip
The referee and your opponent will hold you there
And we're gonna bring in a folding chair
We'll stipulate that there will be no cameras filming
But of course there will be several in the building
And if by chance somebody hits "record"
And stands real still somewhere back behind the soundboard
Cheap electric razor from the Thrifty down the street
Two guys down around your ankles so you'll stay put in your seat
Buzzing razor held aloft and just about to strike
I loved you before I even ever knew what love was like
Some people leave before it's over, but most of them stay
Some hide behind their programs, some turn away
Out in the parking lot you look up at the stars
And all the cheap cars


In the secret caverns underneath West Covina
Half desperate for peace
With the surface dwellers
But coming to no conclusions
And now we emerge
Sky grey and misty
The Grey King in his new Pontiac
Some of us warm to the effort
Trying to get our shapes back
Teeth filed down to fine points
Framework too tight
Strain at the joints
And I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore
I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore
I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore
I'm pretty hardcore but I'm not that hardcore

Load into the Grand Am
Doomed sailors
Born high by the waves
Wild with wonder
Leather and lace and good friends
Most of them good
Most of them friendly
The Grey King at the rail sparks flying
Three others in the car with him
Scared of dying
All eyes on the front seat
Assuming his form
Reborn in the heat

And I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore
I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore
I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore
I'm pretty hardcore but I'm not that hardcore


For several days the visitors were here
We saw them turned down and we watched them disappear
Talked about the days they’d said were sure to come
Had a hard time believing
I remember seeing you, my tongue struck dumb
When you first came here from wherever it was you came from
The power in your voice, your rough touch
You keeping care of me, keeping watch

Open up the doors to the tent
Wonder where the good times went
I will do what you ask me to do
Because of how I feel about you
I saw his little face contract as his eyes met light
Try to imagine anything so bright
You only see it once then it steals into the dawn
And then it’s gone forever
For several hours we lay there, last ones of our kind
Harder days coming maybe, I don't mind
Sounds kind of dumb when I say it, but it's true
I would do anything for you

Open up the promise of the day
Drive the dark things away
I will do what you ask me to do
Because of how I feel about you


In the holding tank I built for myself, it's feeding time
And I start to feel afraid cause I'm the last one left in line
The endless string of summer storms that led me to today
Began one afternoon with you, long ago and far away

And someone leads the beast in on his chain
But I know you're thinking of me cause it's just about to rain
So I won't be afraid of anything ever again
In the cell that holds my body back, the door swings wide
And I feel like someone's lost child as the guards lead me outside
And if the clouds are gathering, it's just to point the way
To an afternoon I spent with you when it rained all day

And someone leads the beast in on his chain
But I know you're thinking of me cause it's just about to rain
So I won't be afraid of anything ever again


I saw the light of my spirit descend the other day
I was standing by the bus stop on North East 33rd
When I got the word
I will be made a new creature
One bright day
I don't have to be afraid
Speed that day on it's way
And you can't tell me what my spirit tells me isn't true, can you?
Woke up on lockdown one more time
My visions won't ever learn
But I see the light that much clearer
Every time I return
Forge my armor in the old fire
My spirit sings loud and clear
Even in here
I'll be reborn someday, someday
If I wait long enough
I don't have to be afraid
I don't wanna be afraid
And you can't tell me what my spirit tells me isn't true, can you?


Scrubbed clean and bright
Checkerboard white and gray
Towels from the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Kingston, Jamaica
I can still see the rust-colored stains today
The stage is set:
Someone's gonna do something someone else will regret
I speak in smoke signals and you answer in code
The fuse will have to run out sometime
Something here will eventually have to explode, have to explode
You and me, lying on the tile floor
Trying to keep cool, restless all night
Sweating out the poison as the temperature climbs
Staring up, up at the hundred-watt light that burns above
Name one thing about us two anyone could love
We roll out the red carpet when rotten luck comes down the road
5, 4, 3, 2, 1--watch for the flak
Something here will eventually have to explode, have to explode


Through the noise I hear you call for help
You can't protect yourself
Frog mask and yellow cape
So desperate to escape
I came to you, hands wrapped in adhesive tape
That was when we were young and green
In the dawning hours of our team

Some things you will remember
Some things stay sweet forever
Seen you backstage once or twice
Animal gimmick pops real nice
Elbows sweep and tiger dance
Little extra fighter's chance
"Hold on", I cried, "I'll be right there"
Pull your mask down through your hair
They won't see you
Not until you want them to
That was when we were green and young
Battle cry rising from your tongue

Some things you will remember
Some things stay sweet forever


Past the rotting wooden stairs
Root out the wine-dark honeyed center
Not everyone can live like billionaires
Look through the air-thin walls
Tear up the floorboards, strip the paint
Go over every inch of space with the patience of a saint
Grab your hat, get your coat
The cellar door is an open throat
Look past the kitchen cabinets
Go through the chest of drawers
Scrutinize the casements
Rip the varnish off the doors
Dig up the laughing photographs
They're here somewhere or other
Take what you can carry
But let me tell you, brother
Still water's going stagnant, bodies bloat
And the cellar door is an open throat


Steam pushing up in billows through the grates
Frankie Lymon's tracking "Seabreeze" in a studio in Harlem
It's 1968
Just a pair of tunes to hammer out
Everybody's off the clock by 10
The loneliest people in the whole wide world
Are the ones you're never going to see again
Feels so free when I hit the avenue
Nothing like a New York summer night
Every dream's a good dream; even awful dreams are good dreams
If you're doing it right
Remember soaring higher than a cloud
Get pretty sentimental now and then
The loneliest people in the whole wide world
Are the ones you're never going to see again
And four hours north of Portland, a radio flips on
And some no-one from the future remembers that you're gone
Armies massing in the dusky distance
Ghosted in the ribbon microphone
Leave a little mark on something, maybe
Take the secret circuit home
Nothing in the shadows but the shadow hands
Reaching out to sad, young, frightened men
The loneliest people in the whole wide world
Are the ones you're never going to see again
Yeah, the loneliest people in the whole wide world
Are the ones you're never going to see again


Take a match in Puerto Rico, why not?
Power and adrenaline flowing like amber
From the recesses of the earth, put on your waders
And twitch
When the water runs high sometimes
Twitch
When the tide ebbs low
See the sights, maybe go downtown
Sometimes you get some heat, sometimes it follows you around
When the blade hits the bone, everybody hears it sing
Shower room full of people, no one hears a goddamned thing
And twitch
When the current runs wild sometimes
Twitch
When the contact howls
All that racket out there in the arena
I’m on a stretcher, here come the cleaners
And the sky goes dark and there I am
Climbing down the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram
I drop from the top of my tall steel cage
Drop to the concrete floor


These roads, leading out to the sea
This day, full of promise and potential
More clay pigeons for you and me
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them, all lined up
Huge crows loitering by the curb
Our shared paths unraveling behind us like ribbons
And I dreamed of vultures in the trees around our house
Cicadas and locusts, and the shrieking of innumerable gibbons
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them, all lined up
How long will we ride this wave out?
How long till someone caves under the pressure?
My dreams are haunted by armies, armies of ghosts
Faces too blurry to make out
Numbers far too high to measure
Your face like a vision straight out of Holly Hobbie
Late light drizzling through your hair
Your eyes, twin volcanoes
Bad ideas dancing around in there
All all of them, all of them
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them, all lined up


We sealed ourselves away from view
You were looking at the void and seldom blinking
The best that I could do
Was to train my eyes on you
We scaled the hidden hills beneath the surface
Scraped our fingers bloody on the stones
And built a little house that we could live in
Out of Dinu Lipatti's bones
We kept our friends at bay all summer long
Treated the days as though they'd kill us if they could
Wringing out the hours like blood-drenched bedsheets
To keep wintertime at bay
But December showed up anyway
There was no money; it was money that you wanted
I went downtown, sold off most of what I owned
And we raised a tower to broadcast all our dark dreams
From Dinu Lipatti's bones


I became a crystal healer and my ministry was to the sick
Creeping vines would send out runners and seek me in their numbers
I sold self-help tapes

Go down to the netherworld, plant grapes

And as the word spread of my powers, they would seek me far and wide
All sad faces at my window, I would welcome them inside
I sewed clothes for them, cloaks and capes
Go down to the netherworld, plant grapes

My house will be for all people who have nowhere to go
My supply of shining crystals a shield against the snow
There's more like me where I come from so mark our shapes

Go down to the netherworld, plant grapes


I wanna ride the hydraulics
Lit up like the North Star
I wanna wallow in the spoils before the crowd
I wanna play my guitar
Not gonna sit up and beg
Not gonna do tricks
Not gonna stand here on a sound stage
Tethered to a crucifix

The ride's over
I know
But I'm not ready to go
I wanna flash my pastel colors by the rail
On a windy day at Pimlico
Don't want to write songs with this clown they set me up with
In a Los Angeles rehearsal studio
Not gonna tour with Trent Reznor
Third of three, bottom of the bill
You can't pay me to make that kind of music
Not gonna swallow that pill

The ride's over
I know
But I'm not ready to go
Maybe dad is right
I'm still young
And I can write C++ just as good as anyone
I know this guy at Lucasarts
He says they're looking for hands
In fifteen years I'll be throwing back beers
With my feet in the sand


Rain everyday
Fog all night
Wind in the evergreen cypresses
See me lord of wind and rain
See me guardian of the underpasses

Wear black when it's light outside
Wear black when there's no light
Wear black following the left hand path
Wear black but I get right
Waves at night
Hard waves at dawn
All this coast is vanishing
Check me out I can't blend in
Check me out I'm young and ravishing

Wear black on your forgotten radar
Wear black in the present tense
Wear black when you come around
Wear black in your absence
Wear black high as a kite (Wear black)
Wear black dead sober (Wear black)
Wear black when the trouble starts (Wear black)
Wear black when it's over (Wear black)

Sun through the trees
Head for the sun
Can't find the path back to the main road
See me lord of the Thomas Guide
See me keeper of the source code

Wear black to the intervention
Wear black back to the car
Wear black wherever I go
Wear black wherever you are


Any child knows how to do the spiderweb dance
Siouxsie has enough hits to keep the bills paid
Every New Year's in Los Angeles you can still see Richard Blade
But the world forgot about Gene Loves Jezebel
Yeah, the world forgot about Gene Loves Jezebel
They charted once or twice
They were on a major label
When the singer went solo
He left money on the table
The two main guys are related
They're at war with each other
Now there's two Genes loving Jezebel
One for each brother
But the world came to agree
What you see is what you get
And what you get is what you see
Whether you're The March Violets or The Bolshoi
Bands who had to leave the darkness for the sun
Red Lorry Yellow Lorry were on Cherry Red I think
They've been playing clubs since 1981
To be fair to Gene Loves Jezebel
Billy Corgan brought them on stage
It was in 2011
It's on their Wikipedia page
But for the most part
However big that chorused bass may throb
You and me and all of us
Are gonna have to find a job
Because the world will never know or understand
The suffocated splendor
Of the once and future goth band


In these last hours, if the spirit waits in check, help me let it go
And should my suffering double, let me never love you less
Let every knee be bent and every tongue confess
And I won't get better
But someday I'll be free
'Cause I am not this body
That imprisons me
I read the magazines somebody brought
Hold them to my failing eyes until my hands get hot
And when the nurse comes in to change my sheets and clothes
The pain begins to travel, dancing as it goes
And I won't get better
But someday I'll be free
'Cause I am not this body
That imprisons me
If my prayer goes unanswered, that's alright
If my path fills with darkness and there's no sign of light
Let me praise you for the good times, let me hold your banner high
Until the hills are flattened and the rivers all run dry
And I won't get better
But someday I'll be free
'Cause I am not this body
That imprisons me


Wake up sixty minutes after my head hits the pillow
I can't live like this
And in the shower I am a sailor
Standing waiting, ready for the ship to list
Everything looks burned up
I'm too scared to look around
Don't feel like going on but
Come on, make a joyful sound
If you will believe in your heart
And confess with your lips
Surely you will be saved one day

Try to think of ways to fix myself
But everything ends in a cul-de-sac
The beast broke from the barn while we were
Sleeping, face it, face it, he's not coming back
Don't see what the point is
In even trying to fight
Look for the bigger picture
When I close my eyes real tight

If you will believe in your heart
And confess with your lips
Surely you will be saved one day

Look for the sign of Daniel
Consider the clues
Wait as long as I have to
For good news

Wake and rise and face the day
And try to stop the day from staring back at me
Busy hours for joyful hearts
And later maybe head out to the pharmacy
Won't take the medication
But it's good to have around
A kind and loving god
Won't let my small ship run aground

If you will believe in your heart
And confess with your lips
Surely you will be saved one day


The story of the pigs who ran straightaway into the water, and their great triumph, woo!

You're gonna send me back to where I came from
Please don't send me back to where I came from
Let me go
Where the white magnolias grow
You're gonna fit me for that orange jumpsuit
Please don't fit me for that orange jumpsuit
Let me ride
Where the dragonflies glide
Yeah, but you're going to do
What you want to do
No matter what
I ask of you
You think you hold the high hand
I've got my doubts
I come from Chino where the asphalt sprouts

Big bus headed southeast from the courthouse
But I'm not headed southeast from the courthouse
Let some mysterious chunk of space debris
Puncture the roof and set me free
And even if I have to go to Claremont
Well I guess I'll just have to go to Claremont
Let me go
Let me lie low

Yeah, but you're going to do
What you want to do
No matter what
I ask of you
And you send your dark messengers
To tempt me
I come from Chino so all your threats are empty
