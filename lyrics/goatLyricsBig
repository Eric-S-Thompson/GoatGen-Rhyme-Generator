I hope that our few remaining friends
Give up on trying to save us
I hope we come up with a fail-safe plot
To piss off the dumb few that forgave us
I hope the fences we mended
Fall down beneath their own weight
And I hope we hang on past the last exit
I hope it's already too late
And I hope the junkyard a few blocks from here
Someday burns down
And I hope the rising black smoke carries me far away
And I never come back to this town again

In my life
I hope I lie, and tell everyone you were a good wife
And I hope you die
I hope we both die

I hope I cut myself shaving tomorrow
I hope it bleeds all day long
Our friends say it's darkest before the sun rises
We're pretty sure they're all wrong
I hope it stays dark forever
I hope the worst isn't over
And I hope you blink before I do
And I hope I never get sober

And I hope when you think of me years down the line
You can't find one good thing to say
And I'd hope that if I found the strength to walk out
You'd stay the hell out of my way
You might also like
I am drowning
There is no sign of land
You are coming down with me
Hand in unlovable hand
And I hope you die
I hope we both die


I broke free on a Saturday morning
I put the pedal to the floor
Headed north on Mills Avenue
And listened to the engine roar

My broken house behind me and good things ahead
A girl named Cathy wants a little of my time
Six cylinders underneath the hood crashing and kicking
Ahaha! Listen to the engine whine
I am going to make it through this year if it kills me
I am going to make it through this year if it kills me

I played video games in a drunken haze
I was seventeen years young
Hurt my knuckles punching the machines
The taste of Scotch rich on my tongue

And then Cathy showed up and we hung out
Trading swigs from a bottle all bitter and clean
Locking eyes, holding hands
Twin high-maintenance machines

I am going to make it through this year if it kills me
I am going to make it through this year if it kills me

I drove home in the California dusk
I could feel the alcohol inside of me hum
Pictured the look on my stepfather's face
Ready for the bad things to come
I downshifted as I pulled into the driveway
The motor screaming out, stuck in second gear
The scene ends badly, as you might imagine
In a cavalcade of anger and fear
There will be feasting and dancing in Jerusalem next year

There's bound to be a ghost at the back of your closet
No matter where you live
There'll always be a few things, maybe several things
That you're going to find really difficult to forgive
There's gonna come a day when you feel better
You'll rise up free and easy on that day
And float from branch to branch
Lighter than the air
Just when that day is coming, who can say? Who can say?
Our mother has been absent ever since we founded Rome
But there's going to be a party when the wolf comes home

We're going to commandeer the local airwaves
To tell the neighbors what's been going on
And they will shake their heads and wag their bony fingers
In all the wrong directions
And by daybreak we'll be gone
I'm going to get myself in fighting trim
Scope out every angle of unfair advantage
I'm gonna bribe the officials
I'm gonna kill all the judges
It's going to take you people years to recover from all of the damage

Our mother has been absent ever since we founded Rome
But there's going to be a party when the wolf comes home


King Saul fell on his sword when it all went wrong
And Joseph's brothers sold him down the river for a song
And Sonny Liston rubbed some Tiger Balm into his glove
Some things you do for money and some you do for love love love

Raskolnikov felt sick but he couldn't say why
When he saw his face reflected in his victim's twinkling eye
Some things you'll do for money and some you'll do for fun
But the things you do for love are going to come back to you one by one
Love love is going to lead you by the hand
Into a white and soundless place
Now we see things as in a mirror dimly
Then we shall see each other face to face

And way out in Seattle, young Kurt Cobain
Snuck out to the greenhouse, put a bullet in his brain
Snakes in the grass beneath our feet, rain in the clouds above
Some moments last forever, but some flare out with love love love


From the ocean to the shore
The warning signs have all been bright and garish
Far too great in number to ignore
From the cities to the swamplands
From the highways to the hills
Our love has never had a leg to stand on
From the aspirins to the cross-tops to the Elavils
But I will walk down to the end with you
If you will come all the way down with me
From the entrance to the exit
Is longer than it looks from where we stand
I want to say I'm sorry for stuff I haven't done yet
Things will shortly get completely out of hand
I can feel it in the rotten air tonight
In the tips of my fingers, in the skin on my face
In the weak last gasp of the evening's dying light
In the way those eyes I've always loved illuminate this place
Like a trashcan fire in a prison cell
Like the searchlights in the parking lots of hell
I will walk down to the end with you
If you will come all the way down with me


The most remarkable thing about coming home to you
Is the feeling of being in motion again;
It's the most extraordinary thing in the world
I have two big hands
And a heart pumping blood
And a 1967 Colt .45 with a busted safety catch

The world shines
As I cross the Macon county line
Going to Georgia
The most remarkable thing about you standing in the doorway
Is that it's you and that you are standing in the doorway
And you smile as you ease the gun from my hand
I am frozen with joy right where I stand
The world throws its light underneath your hair
Forty miles from Atlanta
This is nowhere
Going to Georgia

The world shines
As I cross the Macon county line
Going to Georgia


Were a couple of guys who'd been friends since grade school
One was named Cyrus, and the other was Jeff
And they practiced twice a week in Jeff's bedroom
The best ever death metal band out of Denton
Never settled on a name
But the top three contenders, after weeks of debate
Were "Satan's Fingers," and "The Killers," and "The Hospital Bombers"
Jeff and Cyrus believed in their hearts they were headed
For stage lights and Lear jets, and fortune and fame
So in script that made prominent use of a pentagram
They stenciled their drumheads and guitars with their names
This was how Cyrus got sent to the school
Where they told him he'd never be famous
And this was why Jeff
In the letters he'd write to his friend
Helped develop a plan to get even
When you punish a person for dreaming his dream
Don't expect him to thank or forgive you
The best ever death metal band out of Denton
Will in time both outpace and outlive you
Hail Satan!
Hail Satan tonight!
Hail Satan!
Hail hail!


No one knows where the lone wolf sleeps
No one sees the hidden treasure in the castle keep
No one learns the secret name
No one burns in the absent flame
No one broke D.B. Cooper’s fall
No one hopes to hear the bagman call
Children piping in the main square
But no one’s dancing
No one’s dancing down there
The river goes where the water flows
But no one knows when the Batcave closed
The river goes where the water flows
But no one knows when the Batcave closed

No promise sweeter than a blood pact
Nothing harder to go through with than a vanishing act
No morning colder than the first frost
No friends closer than the ones we’ve lost
Nothing sharper than a serpent’s tooth
Nothing harder than the gospel truth
Though you repent and don sackcloth and try to make nice
You can’t cross the same river twice

The river goes where the water flows
But no one knows when the Batcave closed
The river goes where the water flows
But no one knows when the Batcave closed

There’s a club where you’d like to go
You could meet someone who’s lost like you
Revel in the darkness like a pair of open graves
Fumble through the fog for a season or two
You might also like
No town more barren than our town
No haven safer than the one they tore down
No greater love than to lay my life down for a friend
No sweeter pleasure than to see the credits clear through to the end
No one knows where the lone wolf’s gone
No one sees it camped out right there on the front lawn
We played for you but you would not sing
No one was going to get away with anything

The river goes where the water flows
But no one knows when the Batcave closed
The river goes where the water flows
But no one knows when the Batcave closed


Born down in El Paso where the tumbleweeds blow
To the middleweight champ of all of Mexico
Dad fought many bloody battles, and he raised four sons
Chavo was the oldest one
Old man Gory could pop like a live grenade
Raised his boys in the way of the trade
Hector and Mando, young Eddie G
Chavo meant the most to me

Look high
It's my last hope
Chavo Guerrero
Coming off the top rope
He came from Texas seeking fortune and fame
Rose pretty quickly to the top of his game
Defender of the downtrodden, king of the hill
Tag-team champion with Al Madril
Before a black-and-white TV in the middle of the night
I'm lying on the floor, I'm bathed in blue light
The telecast's in Spanish, I can understand some
And I need justice in my life; here it comes

Look high
It's my last hope
Chavo Guerrero
Coming off the top rope

Red Shoes Dugan
Holding his arm high all out of breath
I hated all of Chavo's enemies
I would pray nightly for their death
Descending like fire
On the people who deserved it most
Almost completely unknown
Outside of Texas and on the West Coast
You might also like
He was my hero back when I was a kid
You let me down, but Chavo never once did
You called him names to try to get beneath my skin
Now, your ashes are scattered on the wind
I heard his son got famous, he went nationwide
Coast-to-coast with his dad by his side
I don't know if that's true, but I've been told
It's real sweet to grow old

Look high
It's my last hope
Chavo Guerrero
Coming off the top rope


Get stomped like a snake
Lie down in the dirt
Cling to my convictions
Even when I get hurt
Be an upstanding, well-loved man about town
In your child’s mind, that’s how it goes down
But I tried the losing side

I don't want to die in here
I don't want to die in here
Drift down into the new, dark light
Without any reservations
You found my breaking point
Congratulations
Spent too much of my life now trying to play fair
Throw my better self overboard
Shoot at him when he comes up for air
Come unhinged, get revenge

I don't want to die in here
I don't want to die in here

Stay good under pressure
For years and years and years and years
President of the fan club
Up there choking on his tears

Let all the trash rain down
From way up in the rafters
I’m walking out of here in one piece
Don’t care what comes after
Drive the wedge, torch the bridge

I checked into a bargain-priced room on La Cienaga
Gazed out through the curtains at the parking lot
Walked down to the corner store just before nightfall in my bare feet
Black tarry asphalt, soft and hot
And when I came back, I spread out my supplies
On the counter by the sink, looked myself right in the eyes

St. Joseph's baby aspirin
Bartles and Jaymes
And you
Or your memory
I ducked behind the drapes when I saw the moon begin to rise
Gathered in my loose ends switched off the light
And down there in the dark I could see the real truth about me
As clear as day, Lord, if I make it through tonight
Then I will mend my ways
And walk the straight path to the end of my days

St. Joseph's baby aspirin
Bartles and Jaymes
And you
Or your memory


When I come home
Spittle bubbling on your lips
Fine white foam
I am young, and I am good
It's a hot southern California day
If I wake you up, there will be hell to pay
And alone in my room
I am the last of a lost civilization
And I vanish into the dark
And rise above my station
Rise above my station
But I do wake you up, and when I do
You blaze down the hall and you scream
I'm in my room with the headphones on
Deep in the dream chamber
And then I'm awake and I'm guarding my face
Hoping you don't break my stereo
Because it's the one thing that I couldn't live without
And so I think about that and then I sorta black out
Held under these smothering waves
By your strong and thick-veined hand
But one of these days I'm going to wriggle up on dry land


Of the near north side
Mount those bridge rails
Ride all night
Scream when captured
Arch your back
Let this whole town hear
Your knuckles crack
Sapphire Trans-Am
High beams in rain
Drive wild broncos
Down the plain
Push up to the corner
Where the turbines hiss
Someday we won't
Remember this
Crawl 'til dawn
On my hands and knees
God damn these vampires
For what they've done to me
Tie those horses
To the post outside
And let those glass doors
Open wide
And in their surface
See two young, savage things
Barely worth
Remembering
Feast like pagans
Never get enough
Sleep like dead men
Wake up like dead men
And when the sun comes
Try not to hate the light
Someday we'll try
To walk upright
Crawl 'til dawn
On my hands and knees
God damn these bite marks
Deep in my arteries
Crawl 'til dawn
On my hands and knees
God damn these vampires
For what they've done to me


This is a song with the same four chords
I use most of the time
When I've got something on my mind
And I don't want to squander the moment
Trying to come up with a better way
To say what I want to say

People were mean to you
But I always thought you were cool
Clicking down the concrete hallways
In your spiked heels
Back in high school
It's good to be young, but let's not kid ourselves
It's better to pass on through those years and come out the other side
With our hearts still beating
Having stared down demons
Come back breathing

People were mean to you
But I always thought you were cool
Clicking down the concrete hallways
In your spiked heels
Back in high school

You deserved better than you got
Someone's got to say it sometime because it's true
People should have told you you were awesome
Instead of taking advantage of you
I hope you love your life now, like I love mine
I hope the painful memories only flex their power over you a little of the time

We held on to hope of better days coming
And when we did we were right
I hope the people who did you wrong
Have trouble sleeping at night

People were mean to you

How bad they'll make you feel
Sometimes you try to freeze time
'Til the slots are a blur of spinning wheels
But I am just a broken machine
And I do things that I don't really mean
Long, black night
Morning frost
I'm still here
But all is lost
Speed up to the precipice
And then slam on the brakes
Some people crash two or three times
And then learn from their mistakes
But we are the ones who don't slow down at all
And there's nobody there to catch us when we fall
Long, black night
Morning frost
I'm still here
But all is lost
Feel the storm every night
Hope it passes by
Hallucinate a shady grove
Where Judas went to die
Unfurl the black velvet altar-cloth
Draw a white-chalk Baphomet
Mistreat your altar boys long enough
And this is what you get
Sad and angry, can't learn how to behave
Still won't know how in the darkness of the grave
You might also likeLong, black night

Alright, I'm on Johnson Avenue in San Luis Obispo
And I'm five years old, or six, maybe
And indications that there's something wrong with our new house
Trip down the wire twice daily

I'm in the living room watching the Watergate hearings
While my stepfather yells at my mother
Launches a glass across the room, straight at her head
And I dash upstairs to take cover
Lean in close to my little record player on the floor
So this is what the volume knob's for

I listen to dance music
Dance music

Okay, so look, I'm 17 years old
And you're the last best thing I've got going
But then the special secret sickness starts to eat through you
What am I supposed to do? No way of knowing

So I follow you down your twisting alleyways
Find a few cul-de-sacs of my own
There's only one place this road ever ends up
And I don't want to die alone

Let me down, let me down, let me down gently
When the police come to get me

I'm listening to dance music
Dance music



Ah the lengthening hours in the refinery
Belching fire into the sky
We do our best vampire routines
As we suck the dying hours dry
The night is lovely as a rose
If I see sunlight hit you
I am sure that we'll both decompose
Ah the fitful sleep and the fire engines
That I dream of when I dream
Some day we'll both wake up for good
I will try hard not to scream
The evening wind will shake the blinds
You're stirring from your slumber
We've got something hateful on our minds

Oh sing, sing, sing
For the dying of the day
Sing for the flames that will rip through here
And the smoke that will carry us away
Yeah sing for the damage we've done
And the worse things that we'll do
Open your mouth up and sing for me now
And I will sing for you



She came in on the red-eye to Dallas-Fort Worth
All the way from sunny Taipei
Skin the color of a walnut shell
And a baseball cap holding down her black hair
And she came here after midnight
The hot weather made her feel right at home

Come on in
We haven't slept for weeks
Drink some of this
It'll put color in your cheeks
He drove in from Mexicali, no worse for wear
Money to burn, time to kill
But five minutes looking in his eyes
And we all knew he was broken pretty bad, so we gave him what we had
We cleared a space for him to sleep in
And we let the silence that's our trademark make its presence felt

Come on in
We haven't slept for weeks
Drink some of this
It'll put color in your cheeks

They came in by the dozens, walking or crawling
Some were bright-eyed, some were dead on their feet
And they came from Zimbabwe, or from Soviet Georgia
East Saint Louis, or from Paris, or they lived across the street
But they came, and when they finally made it here
It was the least that we could do to make our welcome clear

Come on in
We haven't slept for weeks
Drink some of this
This'll put color in your cheeks


I was not there for rehearsal, I don’t need it any more
When I show up just in time to pop, you can clear the goddamn floor
Empty out the locker room, let me find my space
Let him who thinks he knows no fear look well upon my face

Nameless bodies in unremembered rooms
Know how a man becomes a beast when the wolfbane blooms

Sail past all the grasping hands, floodlights white and hot
Bring my vision into focus, find out what I’ve got
Some sniveling local babyface with an angle he can’t sell
Full werewolf off the buckle like an angel straight from hell
Nameless bodies in unremembered rooms
Run howling through the carnage when the wolfbane blooms

Half the city sound asleep and safe inside their beds
Get lost inside my thoughts and nearly tear his face to shreds
Blood pooling on the canvas as the atmosphere gets hushed
Bring your heroes to the wolf’s den, watch them all get crushed
Get told to maybe dial it back backstage later on
Everyone still in this building right now: dead before the dawn

Nameless bodies in unremembered rooms
The pure at heart go putrid when the wolfbane blooms


Hand me your hand, let me look in your eyes
As my last chance to feel human begins to vaporize
Maybe it's the heat in here, maybe it's the pressure
You ought to head for the exits, the sooner the better

I am this great, unstable mass of blood and foam
And no one in her right mind would make my home her home
My heart's an autoclave
My heart's an autoclave (x2)
When I try to open up to you I get completely lost
Houses swallowed by the earth, windows thick with frost
And I reach deep down within, but the pathways twist and turn
And there's no light anywhere, and nothing left to burn

And I am this great, unstable mass of blood and foam
And no emotion that's worth having could call my heart its home
My heart's an autoclave
My heart's an autoclave (x2)

I dreamt that I was perched atop a throne of human skulls
On a cliff above the ocean, howling wind and shrieking seagulls
And the dream went on forever, one single static frame
Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name

I am this great, unstable mass of blood and foam
And no one in her right mind would make her home my home
My heart's an autoclave
My heart's an autoclave (x2)


Whipped like a dog, down on the cards
Square in the spotlight sweating real hard
All soaked in blood like a newborn babe
Sharp thing hidden in my hand shaped like an astrolabe

Gonna stick you in the eye with a foreign object
Gonna poke you in the eye with a foreign object

March through the red mist, never get my vision clear
Learn to love this kind of atmosphere
Strike funny poses, keep my weapon hand low
Whip my head around a little, get blood on the front row
Gonna jab you in the eye with a foreign object
I personally will stab you in the eye with a foreign object
Foreign object, foreign object, foreign object

Sink my teeth into your scalp, take a nice big bite
Save nothing for the cameras, play the angles all night
One of these days my legs will both snap like twigs
If you can't beat ’em make 'em bleed like pigs

I'm gonna jab you in the eye with a foreign object
I'm gonna stab you in the eye with a foreign object

Ba, ba da da, ba ba ba da, foreign object
Ba, ba da da, ba ba ba da, foreign object
Ba, ba da da, ba ba ba da, foreign object


Our love gorges on the alcohol we feed it
And it grows all fat and friendly
We have surplus if we need it
We hold on as hard as we can
Our knuckles are white
We write letters to each other
Invent secrets to confess to
I learn foreign and exotic terms of endearment
By which to address you
We feed fresh fruit to one another
We stay up all night
I am healthy, I am whole
But I have poor impulse control
And I want to go home
But I am home
We are strong, we are faithful
We are guardians of a rare thing
We pay close, careful attention
To the news the morning air brings
We show great loyalty
To the hard times we've been through
We are filled with riches and wonders
Our love keeps the things it finds
And we dance like drunken sailors
Lost at sea, out of our minds
You find shelter somewhere in me
I find great comfort in you
And I keep you safe from harm
You hold me in your arms
You might also likeAnd I want to go home
But I am home


Plums on the tree heavy with nectar
Prayers to summon the destroying angel
Moon stuttering in the sky like film stuck in a projector
And you
You
Twin prop airplanes passing loudly overhead
Road to the airport two lanes clear
Half the whole town gone for the summer
Terrible silence coming down here
And you
You
There is no deadline
There is no schedule
There is no plan we can fall back on
The road this far can't be retraced
There is no punchline anybody can tack on
There are loose ends by the score
What did I come down here for?
You
You


The reception's gotten fuzzy
The delicate balance has shifted
Put on your gloves and your black pumps
Let's pretend the fog has lifted

Now you see me
Now you don't
Now you say you love me
Pretty soon you won't
If we get our full three-score and ten
We won't pass this way again
So kiss me with your mouth open
Turn the tires toward the street
And stay sweet

All the chickens coming home to roost
Plump bodies blotting out the sky
You know it breaks my heart in half, in half
When I see them trying to fly
'Cause you just can't do
Things your body wasn't meant to
Hike up your fishnets
I know you

If we live to see the other side of this
I will remember your kiss
So do it with your mouth open
And take your foot off of the brake
For Christ's sake!


They'd hooked you up to a fentanyl drip
To mitigate the pain a little bit
I flew in from Pennsylvania
When I heard the hour was coming fast
And I docked in Santa Barbara
Tried to brace myself
But you can't brace yourself when the time comes
You just have to roll with the blast

And I'm an eighteen wheeler headed down the interstate
And my brakes are going to give and I won't know until it's too late
Tires screaming when I lose control
Try not to hurt too many people when I roll
Find the Harbor Freeway and head south
Real tired, head kind of light
I found Telegraph Road, I'd only seen the name on envelopes
Found the parking lot and turned right
I felt all the details carving out space in my head
Tropicana's on the walkway, neon red
Between the pain and the pills trying to hold it at bay
Stands a traveler going somewhere far away

And I am an airplane tumbling wing over wing
Tried to listen to my instruments, they don't say anything
People screaming when the engines quit
I hope we're all in crash position when we hit

And then came to your bedside
And as it turns out, I'm not ready
And as though you were speaking through a thick haze
You said hello to me
We all stood there around you
Happy to hear you speak
The last of something bright burning, still burning
Beyond the cancer and the chemotherapy
You might also like
And you were a presence full of light upon this earth
And I am a witness to your life and to its worth
It's three days later when I get the call
And there's nobody around to break my fall


Do every stupid thing that makes you feel alive
Do every stupid thing to try to drive the dark away
Let people call you crazy for the choices that you make
Climb limits past the limits, jump in front of trains all day

And stay alive
Just stay alive

Play with matches if you think you need to play with matches
Seek out the hidden places where the fire burns hot and bright
Find where the heat's unbearable and stay there if you have to
Don't hurt anybody on your way up to the light
And stay alive
Just stay alive

People might laugh at your tattoos
When they do, get new ones in completely garish hues

I hide down in my corner, because I like my corner
I am happy where the vermin play
Make up magic spells; we wear them like protective shells
Landmines on the battlefield; find the one safe way

And stay alive
Just stay alive
Just stay alive


And they drag my body through the streets
And the sun's so hot I think I'll catch fire and burn up
In the summer air so moist and sweet
And the people all come out to cheer
Rocks in the pathway break my skin
And there's honeysuckle on the faint breeze today
With every breath I'm drawing in
I want to cry out
But I don't scream and I don't shout
And I feel so proud to be alive
And I feel so proud when the reckoning arrives
Crowds grow denser by the second
As we near the center of the town
And they dig a trench right in the main square right there
And they pick me up and throw me down
And I start laughing like a child
And I mark their faces one by one
Transfiguration's gonna come for me at last
And I will burn hotter than the sun
I waited so long and now I taste jasmine on my tongue
And I feel so proud to be alive
And I feel so proud when the reckoning arrives


Got up before dawn
Went down to the racetrack
Riding with the windows down
Shortly after your first heart attack
You parked behind the paddock
Cracking asphalt underfoot
Coming up through the cracks

Pale green things
Pale green things
You watched the horses run their workouts
You held your stopwatch in your left hand
And a Racing Form beneath your arm
Casting your gaze way out to no man's land
Sometimes I'll meet you out there
Lonely and frightened
Flicking my tongue out at the wet leaves

Pale green things
Pale green things

My sister called at 3 AM
Just last December
She told me how you'd died at last
At last
That morning at the racetrack
Was one thing I remembered
I turned it over in my mind
Like a living Chinese finger trap
Seaweed in Indiana sawgrass

Pale green things
Pale green things


There's indifference on the wind
But a faint gust of hope
At a club nobody goes to
With a musty velvet rope
Guys in Motörhead jackets
Who knew him way back when
Haven't raised a drink in years
But now meet up again
To remember how it was
When they all thought they'd move away
And ride in Lotus 7s
Through the London streets one day
Nobody ever gets away
Even the best of us come back some day
To the unmarked rooms, where the dry dust breeds
Andrew Eldritch is moving back to Leeds

There's a rusted fog machine
In a concrete storage space
Letter-number combinations
With no meaning on its face
They won't make these anymore
It's a wooden coach-and-four
No-one will even steal it
If you leave it by the door
No sign to mark it's going
No tombstone for its grave
There will be goodbyes by dozens
So practice being brave

No-one anticipates the rush
The breezy feeling of the faceless crush
At the end of things, where the selvage bleeds
Andrew Eldritch is moving back to Leeds
You might also like
They don't throw him a parade
He just comes in on a train
One suitcase in his hand
And an old army backpack
From the second world war
From a Leipzig secondhand store

Pick the keys up from the agent
Everything's been taken care of
No big changes in the roadways
Since you've left that I'm aware of
A few old buildings gone to dust
And some new ones in the way
They'll look just like the old ones
When the winds have had their say
See the children bound for London
You'll all be back too
Everybody tests the membrane
But no-one pushes through

Come on boys that'll be enough
You'd think your old friends wouldn't play so tough
Like a basket by the Nile, hiding down among the reeds
Andrew Eldritch is moving back to Leeds


Was asleep in his car
When your chances fall in your lap like that
You gotta recognize them for what they really are
Nobody in this house
Wants to own up to the truth
I crawl in shotgun and reach into his mouth
And grab hold of one long, sharp tooth
And hold on
For dear life, I hold on
Well of course he wakes up
His paw hits the horn
I am going to regret
The day that I was born
And then mom
Rushes out to the driveway
My sister too
Everyone screaming
I am dreaming of you
I hold on
For dear life, I hold on
And my arms get sore
And my palms start to sweat
And the tears roll down my face
Till my cheeks are hot and red and soaking wet
In come the cops
They blow torch the doors
I start wailing
The lion roars
There's no good way to end this
Anyone can see
There's this great big you
And little old me
And we hold on
For dear life, we hold on
We hold on


Who hurled themselves in to the ocean
When they saw that the explosives in the cargo hold
Were just about to blow
This song is for the soil
That's toxic clear down to the bedrock
Where no thing of consequence can grow
Drop your seeds there
Let them go
Let them all go
Let 'em all go
This song is for the people
Who tell their families that they're sorry
For things they can't and won't feel sorry for
And once there was a desk
And now it's in a storage locker somewhere
And this song is for the stick pins and the cottons
I left in the top drawer
Let 'em all go
Let 'em all go
I wanna sing one for the cars
That are right now headed silent down the highway
And it's dark and there is nobody driving
And something has got to give
I saw you waiting by the roadside
You didn't know that I was watching
Now you know
Let it all go
Let 'em all go
Let it all go


Fog lifts from the harbor, dawn goes down to day
An agent crests the shadows of the nearby alleyway
Piles of broken bricks, sign posts on the path
Every moment points towards the aftermath
Yeah ah ah

Sailors straggle back from their nights out on the town
Hopeless urchins from the city gather around
Spies from imperial China wash in with the tide
Every battle heads toward surrender on both sides
And I am coming home to you
With my own blood in my mouth
And I am coming home to you
If it’s the last thing that I do

Bells ring in the tower, wolves howl in the hills
Chalk marks show up on a few high windowsills
And a rabbit gives up somewhere, and a dozen hawks descend
Every moment leads toward its own sad end
Yeah ah ah

Ships loosed from their moorings capsize and then they’re gone
Sailors with no captains watch awhile and then move on
And an agent crests the shadows and I head in her direction
All roads lead toward the same blocked intersection

I am coming home to you
With my own blood in my mouth
And I am coming home to you
If it’s the last thing that I do


There's only friendly fields and open roads
And you'll sleep better when you think
You've stepped back from the brink
And found some peace inside yourself
Laid down your heavy load
It gets all right to dream at night
Believe in solid skies and slate-blue earth below
But when you see him, you'll know
It's okay to find the faith to saunter forward
With no fear of shadows spreading where you stand
And you'll breathe easier just knowing
That the worst is all behind you
And the waves that tossed the raft all night
Have set you on dry land
It gets okay to praise the day
Believe in sheltering skies and stable earth beneath
But hear his breath come through his teeth
Walk by faith
Tell no one what you've seen
It's so good to learn that from right here
The view goes on forever
And you'll never want for comfort
And you'll never be alone
See the sunset turning red
Let all be quiet in your head
And look about—all the stars are coming out
They shine like steel swords
Wish me well where I go
But when you see me, you'll know


On the morning when I woke up without you for the first time
I felt free, and I felt lonely, and I felt scared
And I began to talk to myself almost immediately
Not being used to being the only person there
Hmmmm

The first time I made coffee for just myself
I made too much of it, but I drank it all
Just cause you hate it when I let things go to waste
And I wandered through the house, like a little boy lost at the mall
And an astronaut could've seen the hunger in my eyes from space
And I sang oh
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do without you?

On the morning when I woke up without you for the first time
I was cold, so I put on a sweater
And I turned up the heat
And the walls began to close in
And I felt so sad and frightened
I practically ran from the living room out into the street
And the wind began to blow and all the trees began to bend
And the world in its cold way started coming alive
And I stood there like a businessman waiting for a train
And I got ready for the future to arrive

And I sang oh
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do without you?


Pulled off the highway in Missouri
And lo, our hearts were heavy laden
Made for the chapel with some spray-paint
For all the things we'd held in secret
Lord, lift up these lifeless bones
Light cascading through the windows
All the rainbow's heavy tones

He has fixed his sign in the sky
He has raised me from the pit and set me high
Left that place in ruin
Drunk on the spirit and high on fumes
Checked into a Red Roof Inn
Stayed up for several hours and then slept like infants
In the burning fuselage of my days
Let my mouth be ever fresh with praise

He has fixed his sign in the sky
He has raised me from the pit and set me high

Each morning new
Each day shot through
With all the sharp, small shards of shrapnel
That seem to burst out of me and you

Head down toward Kansas
We will get there when we get there, don't you worry
Feel bad about the things we do along the way
But not really that bad
We inhaled the frozen air
Lord, send me a mechanic if I'm not beyond repair
You might also like
He has fixed his sign in the sky
He has raised from the pit and he will set me high


'36 Hudson in the garage
All sorts of junk in the unattached spare room
Dishes in the kitchen sink
New straw for the old broom

Friends who don't have a clue
Well-meaning teachers
But down in your arms, in your arms
I am a wild creature
Floor two-foot high with newspapers
White carpet thick with pet hair
Half-eaten gallons of ice cream in the freezer
Fresh fuel for the sodium flares

I write down good reasons to freeze to death
In my spiral ring notebook
But in the long tresses of your hair
I am a babbling brook


You rushed for an average of eight and a third yards per carry
All eyes were on you
Junior year
Blew your knee out at an out-of-town game
Nowhere to go but down, down, down
Nothing but the ground left for you to fall to
By July
You'd made a whole bunch of brand new friends
People you used to look down on,
And you'd figured out a way to make real money
Giving ends to your friends and it felt stupendous,
Chrome spokes on your Japanese bike
But selling acid was a bad idea
And selling it to a cop was a worse one
The new laws said that seventeen-year-olds could do federal time
And you were the first one
So I sing this song for you
William Staniforth Donahue,
Your grandfather rode the boat over from Ireland
But you made a bad decision or two, yeah


Well, guy in a skeleton costume
Comes up to the guy in the Superman suit
Runs through him with a broadsword

I flip the television off
Bring all the bright lights up
Turn the radio up loud
I don't know why I'm so persuaded
That if I think things through
Long enough and hard enough
I'll somehow get to you
But then you came in
And we locked eyes
You kicked the ashtray over as we came toward each other
Stubbed my cigarette out against the west wall
Quickly lit another

Look at that
Would you look at that
We're throwing off sparks
What will I do when I don't have you to hold onto in the dark?

Yes, everybody's gonna need a witness
Everybody's gonna need a little backup in case the scene gets nasty
You throw the attic window open
And I throw myself all around you
And night comes to Tallahassee
I don't know why it's gotten harder
To keep myself away
I thought I'd finally beat the feeling back
It all came back today
And then we fell down
And we locked arms
We knocked the dresser over as we rolled across the floor
I don't mean it when I tell you
That I don't love you anymore
You might also like
Look at that
Would you look at that
The way the ceiling starts to swerve
What will I do when I don't have you
When I finally get what I deserve


Crank that siren high
Drain the wellspring dry
Map out your coordinates
Send out scouts by day
Dole out mercenary pay
For restless young subordinates
It never hurts to give thanks to the local gods
You never know who might be hungry
It never hurts to scan the windows on the upper floor
I saw a face there once before when I was younger
Set the torch aflame
Call the night by name
Stake out your dark position
Lie in wait
By the gleaming city gate
Try not to lose sight of the mission
It never hurts to give thanks to the broken bones
You had to use to build your ladder

Moment close at hand
Half of you will never understand
And it doesn't really matter
Big smile on my face
Capsule just in case
Underneath my tongue there
Voices on the breeze
I heard voices once like these when I was younger

Blood rushing to my face
I know that sweet warm taste
And the bitter trace

Storm right down that hill
If I don’t, no one will
Follow me right through the chaos
This whole house is doomed
Even the bit-parts get consumed
Prepare a grave for Menelaus
It never hurts to give thanks to the navigator
Even when he's spitting out random numbers
I knew what those figures meant
And what they hoped to represent
When I was younger



When the radiator burst
I was three sheets to the wind
A civilian saw me first
And then there was the cop
And then the children standing on the corner
Your love is like a cyclone in a swamp
And the weather's getting warmer
I was getting out of jail
Heading to the Greyhound
You said you'd hop on one yourself
And meet me on the way down
I was shaking way too hard to think
Dead on my feet about to drop
Went and got the case of vodka from a car
And walked the two miles to the bus stop
Got on the bus half drunk again
The driver glared at me
Met up with you in Inglis
Thumbed a ride to Cedar Key
If we never make it back to California
I want you to know I love ya
But my love is like a dark cloud full of rain
That's always right there up above you
Hey!


We took a weekend, drove to Provo
The snow was white and fluffy
A weekend in Utah won't fix what's wrong with us
The gray sky was vast and real cryptic above me

I wanted you
To love me like you used to do

We took two weeks in the Bahamas
Went out dancing every night
Tried to fight the creeping sense of dread with temporal things
Most of the time I guess I felt alright
But I wanted you
To love me like you used to do

But you cannot run
And you cannot hide
From the wreck we've made of our house
From the mess inside

We went down to New Orleans
One weekend in the spring
Looked hard for what we'd lost
It was painful to admit it but we couldn't find a thing

I wanted you
To love me like you used to do

We went to New York City in September
Took the train out of Manhattan to the Grand Army stop
Found that bench we'd sat together on a thousand years ago
When I felt such love for you I thought my heart was gonna pop
You might also like
I wanted you
To love me like you used to do

But I cannot run
And I can't hide
From the wreck we've made of our house
From the mess inside


Of our southwestern ranch-style house
On a new Kawasaki
All yellow and black
Fresh out of the showroom
Our house faced west
So the big orange sun
Positioned at your back
Lit up your magnificent silhouette
How much better, how much better can my life get?
900 cubic centimeters of raw, whining power
No outstanding warrants for my arrest
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
The pirate's life for me
I hopped on the back of the bike
Wrapped my arms around you
And I sank my face into your hair
And then I inhaled as deeply as I possibly could
You were as sweet and delicious as the warm desert air
And you pointed your headlamp toward the horizon
We were the one thing in the galaxy
God didn't have his eyes on
900 cc's of raw, whining power
No outstanding warrants for my arrest
Hi diddle dee dee, goddamn
The pirate's life for me


My love is like a powder keg
In the corner of an empty warehouse
Somewhere just outside of town
About to burn down
My love is like a Cuban plane
My love is like a Cuban plane
Flying from Havana
Up the Florida coast to the 'Glades
Soviet made
Our love is like the border between Greece and Albania
Our love is like the border between Greece and Albania
Trucks loaded down with weapons
Crossing over every night
Moon yellow and bright
There is a shortage in the blood supply
But there is no shortage of blood
The way I feel about you baby can't explain it
You got the best of my love


Holt Boulevard
Between Garey and White
Hooked up with some friends at the Travelodge
Set ourselves up for the night
Carpenter ants in the dresser
Flies in the screen
It will be too late by the time we learn
What these cryptic symbols mean

And I dreamt of a house
Haunted by all you tweakers with your hands out
And the headstones climbed up the hills
Send somebody out for soda
Comb through the carpet for clues
Reflective tape on our sweatpants
Big holes in our shoes
Every couple minutes
Someone says he can't stand it anymore
Laugh lines on our faces
Scale maps of the ocean floor

And I dreamt of a camera
Pointed out from inside the television
And the aperture yawning and blinking
And the headstones climbed up the hills

If anybody comes to see me
Tell them they just missed me by a minute
If anybody comes into our room while we're asleep
I hope they incinerate everybody in it

And I dreamt of a factory
Where they manufacture what I needed
Using shiny new machines
And the headstones climbed up the hills


Scratch at the chain links, maybe bare my teeth for show
Fed twice a day, I don't go hungry anymore
Feel in my bones just what the future has in store
I pace in circles
So the camera will see
Look hard at my stripes
There'll be no more after me
Laze by the shoreline while the sailors disembark
Scratch out a place to sit and rest down in the dark
Smell something burning downwind just a little ways
They set up camp and sing and sweat and work for days
I have no fear of anyone
I'm dumb and wild and free
I am a flightless bird
And there'll be no more after me
In Costa Rica, in a burrow underground
Climb to the surface, blink my eyes and look around
I'm all alone here as I try my tiny song
Claim my place beneath the sky, but I won't be here for long
I sang all night
The moon shone on me through the trees
No brothers left
And there'll be no more after me


Bad luck comes in from Tampa
On the back of a truck
Doing ninety up the interstate
We have bad dreams the night he rolls in
We have bad dreams the night he rolls in
And we try to keep our spirits high
But they flag and they wane
When the truck pulls up out front
In the light spring rain
And they sag like withering flowers
Let the good times roll on
Through these first few desperate hours
Yeah the driver drops his cargo at the curb
The driver drops his cargo at the curb
And the sun peeks in
Like a killer through the curtain
And when cloven hoof prints turn up in the garden
Yeah when cloven hoof prints turn up in the garden
We keep up the good fight
We keep our spirits light
But they drop like flies
And there's a stomach-churning shift
In the way the land lies
And they lean like towers
On a hillside struggling to stand
Through these first few desperate hours
Yeah


After one long season of waiting
After one long season of wanting
I am breaking open
My insides are pink and raw
And it hurts me when I move my jaw
But I am taking tiny steps forward

And I feel sure that my wounds will heal
And I will bloom here in my room
With a little water and a little bit of sunlight
And a little bit of tender mercy, tender mercy


The big trucks come up the highway
And the big wheels rattle my windows
And night, night comes to Texas
After one blind season alone in here
After one long, sweltering summer
I, I'm going to find the exit

And I will go to the house of a friend I know
And I will let myself forget

With a little water and a little bit of sunlight
And a little bit of tender mercy, tender mercy



Once a week I make the drive, two hours east
To check the Austin post office box
And I make the detour through our old neighborhood
See all the Chevy Impalas in their front yards up on blocks
And I park in an alley
And I read through the postcards you continue to send
Where as indirectly as you can, you ask what I remember
I like these torture devices from my old best friend
Well, I'll tell you what I know, like I swore I always would
I don't think it's gonna do you any good
I remember the train headed south out of Bangkok
Down toward the water

I always get a late start when the sun's going down
And the traffic's thinning out and the glare is hard to take
I wish the West Texas Highway was a Möbius strip
I could ride it out forever
When I feel my heart break
I almost swear I hear it happen, it's that clear and that hard
I come in off the highway and I park in my front yard
Fall out of the car like a hostage from a plane
Think of you a while, start wishing it would rain

I remember the train headed south out of Bangkok
Down toward the water

I come into the house, put on a pot of coffee
Walk the floors a little while
I set your postcard on the table with all the others like it
I start sorting through the pile
I check the pictures and the postmarks and the captions and the stamps
For signs of any pattern at all
When I come up empty-handed the feeling almost overwhelms me
I let a few of my defenses fall
And I smile a bitter smile, it's not a pretty thing to see
I think about a railroad platform back in 1983

Hello there, Paul!
I had a take and I listened to it
And I was ready to send it and I thought:
You know? It can be done better
So here it is, then
Now I'm wearing my boots
Which always guarantees a good showing

You must try to lead a good life
You must do unto others as you would have them do
So that when you die, you'll find Golden Boy peanuts
Waiting in the afterlife for you
There are no pan-Asian supermarkets down in hell
So you can't buy Golden Boy peanuts
There are no pan-Asian supermarkets down in hell
So you can't buy Golden Boy peanuts

If thine enemy oppresseth you
You must let him oppress you some more
So that when you go shopping in paradise
You'll find those magnificent peanuts from Singapore
With the drawing of the young Chinese farmer
The eastern sun behind him smiling at you from the shelves
If we want to spend eternity in happiness
Well we're gonna have watch ourselves
You must give to the March of Dimes
You must be on guard against wickedness at all times
And you will find that your efforts have brought you great joy
When your spirit is munching on that Golden Boy

There are no pan-Asian supermarkets down in hell
So you can't buy Golden Boy peanuts there
But the streets of heaven are lined with shells
And there's billboards of the Golden Boy everywhere

Masks hanging on the tomb walls
Where the coven grieves
Witches hiding in the brambles
Ground level down where the dry leaves
Blow, and burn slowly
No ground is ever gonna hold me
White candles in the manor, where the curse takes hold
Bodies reassembling down where the worms crawl
Make your own friends when the world's gone cold
It gets dark and then
I feel certain I am going to rise again
If not by faith then by the sword
I'm going to be restored

Build fires to keep the beacon flashing
Where the earth lies flat
Blood calls to blood as the hours draw down
Invent my own family if it comes to that
Hold them close, hold them near
Tell them no one's ever going to hurt them here
Steal the treasure and try to leave town
Fight my way back down, don't want to hurt anyone
Probably gonna have to before it's all done

Take to the hills, run away
I'm gonna get my perfect body back someday
If not by faith then by the sword
I'm going to be restored


The men were here to get your Belgian things
They'll store them for you in an airplane hangar
There's guys in biohazard suits
Mud caking on their rubber boots
They've come to keep your pretty things from danger

The men were here to get your Belgian things
They'll spend the whole day hauling them downstairs
I shot a roll of thirty-two exposures
My camera groans beneath the weight it bears
I can see you in my sleep
Playing the points for all you're worth
Walking gingerly across the
Bruised earth

The men were here to get your Belgian things
They waltzed right through the door and went fluorescent
Their boots were black and shiny and your treasures gleamed like stars
Bones from deep down in the fertile crescent

The arteries are clogging in the mainframe
There's too much information in the pipes
I saw the mess you left up in the east bedroom
A tiger's never gonna change its stripes

I guess
I guess but Jesus what a mess
One way in and no way out

The men were here to get your Belgian things
And only I was here to see them do it
I wish you had a number where you are
It's hard with no one here to help me through it

But everybody is out here on the streets
Somebody's opened up a fire hydrant
Cold water rushing out in sheets
Some kid in a Marcus Allen jersey
Asks me for a cigarette
Companionship is where you find it
So I take what I can get
Hubcaps on the cars like fun house mirrors
Stick to the shadows when I can
Lovecraft in Brooklyn
When the sun goes down the armies of the voiceless
Several hundred-thousand strong
Come out without their bandages
Their voices raised in song
And when the street lights sputter out
They make this awful sizzling sound
I cast my gaze toward the pavement
Too many blood stains on the ground
Rhode Island drops into the ocean
No place to call home anymore
Lovecraft in Brooklyn
Head outside most everyday
To try to keep the wolves away
Imagine nice things I might say
If company should come
Woke up afraid of my own shadow
Like, genuinely afraid
Headed for the pawnshop
To buy myself a switchblade
Someday something's coming
From way out beyond the stars
To kill us while we stand here
It'll store our brains in Mason jars

Small screen, July evening view
Up and down Grand Avenue
Where the legends get made
Out with the Boys' Brigade
Part of the motorcade

Flew home from Texas last night
Slept on the flight
Work like a dog all day
Born to chase cars away
Die on the road someday
I try to remember what life was like long ago
But it's gone, you know

Climb the turnbuckle high
Take two falls out of three
Blackout for local TV

Stand in that cold empty hall
Wait for your name to get called
Burn like hillsides on fire
In the squall of the ringside choir
High as a wire

Nearly drive Danny's nose back into his brain
All the cheap seats go insane
Keep my eyes open and try to think straight
No one drives on the 60 this late
Feel like the last person alive
Francisquito to Glenshaw Drive

I try to remember to write in the diary
That my son gave me

I'll drink to your health and you drink to mine
As we try
To make the money we scored out in Vegas hold out for a while
We drink vodka from Russia
We got our chocolates from Belgium
We have our strawberries flown in from England
But none of the money we spend
Seems to do us much good in the end
I got a cracked engine block, both of us do
Yeah, the house and the jewels, the Italian racecar
They don't make us feel better about who we are
I got termites in the framework, so do you
Down here where the watermelon grows so sweet
Where I worship the ground underneath of your feet
We are experts in the art of frivolous spending
It's gone on like this for three years I guess
And we're drunk all the time and our lives are a mess
And the deathless love we swore to protect with our bodies
Is stumbling across its bleak ending
But none of the rage in our eyes
Seems to finish it off where it lies
I got sugar in the fuel lines, both of us do
All the fights and the lies that we both love to tell
Fail to send our love to its reward down in hell
I got pudding for a backbone but so do you
La la la La, hey hey


All reserves completely spent
Someone set up the oxygen tent
Everybody here's real proud to present
Choked out
Two hundred dollar take-all purse
Half-nelson to suplex reverse
Worried look on the face of the ringside nurse
At one, for once, with the universe
Choked out
Choked out
Choked out
Choked out
I stretch and strain with all my might
Drift off into the velvety arms of the night
Kick and claw and scratch and bite
Fire up the grill, everybody eats tonight
Choked out
No brakes down, an endless dark incline
Most of the boys won't ever cross this line
If they all want to die dead broke that's fine, that's fine
Everybody's got their limits, nobody's found mine
Crowd screaming like hounds at the heat of the chase
All the colors of the rainbow flood my face
I lift right off into space
I can see the future, it's a real dark place
Choked out
Choked out
Choked out
Choked out
Choked out
Choked out


Crawling in the Colosseum dust
Who can count on his remaining limbs
All the people he can trust
Like the one who stands behind him
Cheering him on
Ecstatic when he stands defiant
Wild with abandon when he's gone
Just stay alive
Keep your eyes on the pay line
Like a village on the steppe
About to get collectivized
When the men emerge with rifles from the haystack
Everybody looks surprised
Like the mice in the forgotten grain
Way up on the top shelf
Like someone who's found a small town to escape to
Keeps one eye on his abandoned, former self
Stay in the game
Just try to play through the pain
Like a fighter who's been told it's finally time for him to quit
Show up in shining colours
And then stand there and get hit
Like the clock that ticks in Dresden
When the whole town's been destroyed
Like the nagging flash of insight
You're always desperate to avoid
Like the bloody-knuckled gunman
Still stationed at the breach
Like that board game with the sliders
And the children on the beach
Stay alive
Maybe spit blood at the camera
Just stay alive
Stay forever alive


Spring rain was misting down on Kingston
And down at the harbor
Local cops were intercepting an inbound shipment
And for a while there it was chaos
As they handcuffed and then roughed up some sailors
On the day my lung collapses
It's not going to be much different
On the day that Dennis Brown's habits caught up with him
School children sang in choirs
And out behind the Chinese restaurants
Guys were jumping into dumpsters
And the stench was overbearing
But they were past the point of caring
On the day my habits catch up with me
I'll be down among the jumpers
And when the birds come home in spring
We will fill them full of buckshot
And jets of contaminated blood
Will cloud the rivers and the lakes
It took all the coke in town
To bring down Dennis Brown
On the day my lung collapses
We'll see just how much it takes


Drawn to the dark
Covered by the blood when possible
Call to the corners
To any open crucible
Easy to reach
Bearing every mark unmissably
Wanna leave behind some token of what I carried with me
Search in the storm drains
Sleep in the underpasses
Try hard to look hard
Behind my blackout sunglasses
But I have high unicorn tolerance
I have high unicorn tolerance
I have high unicorn tolerance
I have high unicorn tolerance

Swim with real sharks
Those who never speak when spoken to
Hard limits fade into memory
Once broken through
Scaling the well
Every single day instinctively
Feel shame real shame
For what my friends must think of me
Dig through the graveyard
Rub the bones against my face
It gets real nice around the graveyard
Once you've acquired the taste
And when the clouds do clear away
Get a momentary chance to see
The thing I've been trying to beat to death
The soft creature that I used to be
The better animal I used to be
Draw where I'm drawn
Seldom wonder why, just follow you
Never blame the rags that swallowed me
For the place the river took me to
Long life to the spiders
Safe travels to the crows
Love to the ghosts
Who taught me everything I know

You've got whatever's left of me to get
Our conversations are like minefields
No one's found a safe way through one yet
I spend a lot of money
I buy you white gold
We raise up a little roof
Against the cold
On Southwood Plantation Road
Where at night the stars blow like milk across the sky
Where the high wires drop
Where the fat crows fly
All night long you giggle and scream
Your brown eyes deeper than a dream
I am not going to lose you
We are going to stay married
In this house like a Louisiana graveyard
Where nothing stays buried
On Southwood Plantation Road
Where the dead will walk again
Put on their Sunday best
And mingle with unsuspecting Christian men
La la la la la


No one anticipates the sunset flip
The referee and your opponent will hold you there
And we're gonna bring in a folding chair
We'll stipulate that there will be no cameras filming
But of course there will be several in the building
And if by chance somebody hits "record"
And stands real still somewhere back behind the soundboard
Cheap electric razor from the Thrifty down the street
Two guys down around your ankles so you'll stay put in your seat
Buzzing razor held aloft and just about to strike
I loved you before I even ever knew what love was like
Some people leave before it's over, but most of them stay
Some hide behind their programs, some turn away
Out in the parking lot you look up at the stars
And all the cheap cars


In the secret caverns underneath West Covina
Half desperate for peace
With the surface dwellers
But coming to no conclusions
And now we emerge
Sky grey and misty
The Grey King in his new Pontiac
Some of us warm to the effort
Trying to get our shapes back
Teeth filed down to fine points
Framework too tight
Strain at the joints
And I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore
I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore
I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore
I'm pretty hardcore but I'm not that hardcore

Load into the Grand Am
Doomed sailors
Born high by the waves
Wild with wonder
Leather and lace and good friends
Most of them good
Most of them friendly
The Grey King at the rail sparks flying
Three others in the car with him
Scared of dying
All eyes on the front seat
Assuming his form
Reborn in the heat

And I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore
I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore
I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore
I'm pretty hardcore but I'm not that hardcore


For several days the visitors were here
We saw them turned down and we watched them disappear
Talked about the days they’d said were sure to come
Had a hard time believing
I remember seeing you, my tongue struck dumb
When you first came here from wherever it was you came from
The power in your voice, your rough touch
You keeping care of me, keeping watch

Open up the doors to the tent
Wonder where the good times went
I will do what you ask me to do
Because of how I feel about you
I saw his little face contract as his eyes met light
Try to imagine anything so bright
You only see it once then it steals into the dawn
And then it’s gone forever
For several hours we lay there, last ones of our kind
Harder days coming maybe, I don't mind
Sounds kind of dumb when I say it, but it's true
I would do anything for you

Open up the promise of the day
Drive the dark things away
I will do what you ask me to do
Because of how I feel about you


In the holding tank I built for myself, it's feeding time
And I start to feel afraid cause I'm the last one left in line
The endless string of summer storms that led me to today
Began one afternoon with you, long ago and far away

And someone leads the beast in on his chain
But I know you're thinking of me cause it's just about to rain
So I won't be afraid of anything ever again
In the cell that holds my body back, the door swings wide
And I feel like someone's lost child as the guards lead me outside
And if the clouds are gathering, it's just to point the way
To an afternoon I spent with you when it rained all day

And someone leads the beast in on his chain
But I know you're thinking of me cause it's just about to rain
So I won't be afraid of anything ever again


I saw the light of my spirit descend the other day
I was standing by the bus stop on North East 33rd
When I got the word
I will be made a new creature
One bright day
I don't have to be afraid
Speed that day on it's way
And you can't tell me what my spirit tells me isn't true, can you?
Woke up on lockdown one more time
My visions won't ever learn
But I see the light that much clearer
Every time I return
Forge my armor in the old fire
My spirit sings loud and clear
Even in here
I'll be reborn someday, someday
If I wait long enough
I don't have to be afraid
I don't wanna be afraid
And you can't tell me what my spirit tells me isn't true, can you?


Scrubbed clean and bright
Checkerboard white and gray
Towels from the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Kingston, Jamaica
I can still see the rust-colored stains today
The stage is set:
Someone's gonna do something someone else will regret
I speak in smoke signals and you answer in code
The fuse will have to run out sometime
Something here will eventually have to explode, have to explode
You and me, lying on the tile floor
Trying to keep cool, restless all night
Sweating out the poison as the temperature climbs
Staring up, up at the hundred-watt light that burns above
Name one thing about us two anyone could love
We roll out the red carpet when rotten luck comes down the road
5, 4, 3, 2, 1--watch for the flak
Something here will eventually have to explode, have to explode


Through the noise I hear you call for help
You can't protect yourself
Frog mask and yellow cape
So desperate to escape
I came to you, hands wrapped in adhesive tape
That was when we were young and green
In the dawning hours of our team

Some things you will remember
Some things stay sweet forever
Seen you backstage once or twice
Animal gimmick pops real nice
Elbows sweep and tiger dance
Little extra fighter's chance
"Hold on", I cried, "I'll be right there"
Pull your mask down through your hair
They won't see you
Not until you want them to
That was when we were green and young
Battle cry rising from your tongue

Some things you will remember
Some things stay sweet forever


Past the rotting wooden stairs
Root out the wine-dark honeyed center
Not everyone can live like billionaires
Look through the air-thin walls
Tear up the floorboards, strip the paint
Go over every inch of space with the patience of a saint
Grab your hat, get your coat
The cellar door is an open throat
Look past the kitchen cabinets
Go through the chest of drawers
Scrutinize the casements
Rip the varnish off the doors
Dig up the laughing photographs
They're here somewhere or other
Take what you can carry
But let me tell you, brother
Still water's going stagnant, bodies bloat
And the cellar door is an open throat


Steam pushing up in billows through the grates
Frankie Lymon's tracking "Seabreeze" in a studio in Harlem
It's 1968
Just a pair of tunes to hammer out
Everybody's off the clock by 10
The loneliest people in the whole wide world
Are the ones you're never going to see again
Feels so free when I hit the avenue
Nothing like a New York summer night
Every dream's a good dream; even awful dreams are good dreams
If you're doing it right
Remember soaring higher than a cloud
Get pretty sentimental now and then
The loneliest people in the whole wide world
Are the ones you're never going to see again
And four hours north of Portland, a radio flips on
And some no-one from the future remembers that you're gone
Armies massing in the dusky distance
Ghosted in the ribbon microphone
Leave a little mark on something, maybe
Take the secret circuit home
Nothing in the shadows but the shadow hands
Reaching out to sad, young, frightened men
The loneliest people in the whole wide world
Are the ones you're never going to see again
Yeah, the loneliest people in the whole wide world
Are the ones you're never going to see again


Take a match in Puerto Rico, why not?
Power and adrenaline flowing like amber
From the recesses of the earth, put on your waders
And twitch
When the water runs high sometimes
Twitch
When the tide ebbs low
See the sights, maybe go downtown
Sometimes you get some heat, sometimes it follows you around
When the blade hits the bone, everybody hears it sing
Shower room full of people, no one hears a goddamned thing
And twitch
When the current runs wild sometimes
Twitch
When the contact howls
All that racket out there in the arena
I’m on a stretcher, here come the cleaners
And the sky goes dark and there I am
Climbing down the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram
I drop from the top of my tall steel cage
Drop to the concrete floor


These roads, leading out to the sea
This day, full of promise and potential
More clay pigeons for you and me
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them, all lined up
Huge crows loitering by the curb
Our shared paths unraveling behind us like ribbons
And I dreamed of vultures in the trees around our house
Cicadas and locusts, and the shrieking of innumerable gibbons
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them, all lined up
How long will we ride this wave out?
How long till someone caves under the pressure?
My dreams are haunted by armies, armies of ghosts
Faces too blurry to make out
Numbers far too high to measure
Your face like a vision straight out of Holly Hobbie
Late light drizzling through your hair
Your eyes, twin volcanoes
Bad ideas dancing around in there
All all of them, all of them
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them
All of them, all of them, all lined up


We sealed ourselves away from view
You were looking at the void and seldom blinking
The best that I could do
Was to train my eyes on you
We scaled the hidden hills beneath the surface
Scraped our fingers bloody on the stones
And built a little house that we could live in
Out of Dinu Lipatti's bones
We kept our friends at bay all summer long
Treated the days as though they'd kill us if they could
Wringing out the hours like blood-drenched bedsheets
To keep wintertime at bay
But December showed up anyway
There was no money; it was money that you wanted
I went downtown, sold off most of what I owned
And we raised a tower to broadcast all our dark dreams
From Dinu Lipatti's bones


I became a crystal healer and my ministry was to the sick
Creeping vines would send out runners and seek me in their numbers
I sold self-help tapes

Go down to the netherworld, plant grapes

And as the word spread of my powers, they would seek me far and wide
All sad faces at my window, I would welcome them inside
I sewed clothes for them, cloaks and capes
Go down to the netherworld, plant grapes

My house will be for all people who have nowhere to go
My supply of shining crystals a shield against the snow
There's more like me where I come from so mark our shapes

Go down to the netherworld, plant grapes


I wanna ride the hydraulics
Lit up like the North Star
I wanna wallow in the spoils before the crowd
I wanna play my guitar
Not gonna sit up and beg
Not gonna do tricks
Not gonna stand here on a sound stage
Tethered to a crucifix

The ride's over
I know
But I'm not ready to go
I wanna flash my pastel colors by the rail
On a windy day at Pimlico
Don't want to write songs with this clown they set me up with
In a Los Angeles rehearsal studio
Not gonna tour with Trent Reznor
Third of three, bottom of the bill
You can't pay me to make that kind of music
Not gonna swallow that pill

The ride's over
I know
But I'm not ready to go
Maybe dad is right
I'm still young
And I can write C++ just as good as anyone
I know this guy at Lucasarts
He says they're looking for hands
In fifteen years I'll be throwing back beers
With my feet in the sand


Rain everyday
Fog all night
Wind in the evergreen cypresses
See me lord of wind and rain
See me guardian of the underpasses

Wear black when it's light outside
Wear black when there's no light
Wear black following the left hand path
Wear black but I get right
Waves at night
Hard waves at dawn
All this coast is vanishing
Check me out I can't blend in
Check me out I'm young and ravishing

Wear black on your forgotten radar
Wear black in the present tense
Wear black when you come around
Wear black in your absence
Wear black high as a kite (Wear black)
Wear black dead sober (Wear black)
Wear black when the trouble starts (Wear black)
Wear black when it's over (Wear black)

Sun through the trees
Head for the sun
Can't find the path back to the main road
See me lord of the Thomas Guide
See me keeper of the source code

Wear black to the intervention
Wear black back to the car
Wear black wherever I go
Wear black wherever you are


Any child knows how to do the spiderweb dance
Siouxsie has enough hits to keep the bills paid
Every New Year's in Los Angeles you can still see Richard Blade
But the world forgot about Gene Loves Jezebel
Yeah, the world forgot about Gene Loves Jezebel
They charted once or twice
They were on a major label
When the singer went solo
He left money on the table
The two main guys are related
They're at war with each other
Now there's two Genes loving Jezebel
One for each brother
But the world came to agree
What you see is what you get
And what you get is what you see
Whether you're The March Violets or The Bolshoi
Bands who had to leave the darkness for the sun
Red Lorry Yellow Lorry were on Cherry Red I think
They've been playing clubs since 1981
To be fair to Gene Loves Jezebel
Billy Corgan brought them on stage
It was in 2011
It's on their Wikipedia page
But for the most part
However big that chorused bass may throb
You and me and all of us
Are gonna have to find a job
Because the world will never know or understand
The suffocated splendor
Of the once and future goth band


In these last hours, if the spirit waits in check, help me let it go
And should my suffering double, let me never love you less
Let every knee be bent and every tongue confess
And I won't get better
But someday I'll be free
'Cause I am not this body
That imprisons me
I read the magazines somebody brought
Hold them to my failing eyes until my hands get hot
And when the nurse comes in to change my sheets and clothes
The pain begins to travel, dancing as it goes
And I won't get better
But someday I'll be free
'Cause I am not this body
That imprisons me
If my prayer goes unanswered, that's alright
If my path fills with darkness and there's no sign of light
Let me praise you for the good times, let me hold your banner high
Until the hills are flattened and the rivers all run dry
And I won't get better
But someday I'll be free
'Cause I am not this body
That imprisons me


Wake up sixty minutes after my head hits the pillow
I can't live like this
And in the shower I am a sailor
Standing waiting, ready for the ship to list
Everything looks burned up
I'm too scared to look around
Don't feel like going on but
Come on, make a joyful sound
If you will believe in your heart
And confess with your lips
Surely you will be saved one day

Try to think of ways to fix myself
But everything ends in a cul-de-sac
The beast broke from the barn while we were
Sleeping, face it, face it, he's not coming back
Don't see what the point is
In even trying to fight
Look for the bigger picture
When I close my eyes real tight

If you will believe in your heart
And confess with your lips
Surely you will be saved one day

Look for the sign of Daniel
Consider the clues
Wait as long as I have to
For good news
You might also like
Wake and rise and face the day
And try to stop the day from staring back at me
Busy hours for joyful hearts
And later maybe head out to the pharmacy
Won't take the medication
But it's good to have around
A kind and loving god
Won't let my small ship run aground

If you will believe in your heart
And confess with your lips
Surely you will be saved one day


The story of the pigs who ran straightaway into the water, and their great triumph, woo!

You're gonna send me back to where I came from
Please don't send me back to where I came from
Let me go
Where the white magnolias grow
You're gonna fit me for that orange jumpsuit
Please don't fit me for that orange jumpsuit
Let me ride
Where the dragonflies glide
Yeah, but you're going to do
What you want to do
No matter what
I ask of you
You think you hold the high hand
I've got my doubts
I come from Chino where the asphalt sprouts

Big bus headed southeast from the courthouse
But I'm not headed southeast from the courthouse
Let some mysterious chunk of space debris
Puncture the roof and set me free
And even if I have to go to Claremont
Well I guess I'll just have to go to Claremont
Let me go
Let me lie low

Yeah, but you're going to do
What you want to do
No matter what
I ask of you
And you send your dark messengers
To tempt me
I come from Chino so all your threats are empty


I hit the cul-de-sac on the spiritual path
Retraced my steps back home
But the house burneddownbefore I gotthere
And I found myself alone
I triedto keep things in perspective
As I hunted down the perpetrator
Loadedupmytoolkit with everyhateful instrument
Now herewe are thirty years later
I'm getting into knives
I'm getting into knives
I've been up and down the buffet several different times
I'm adjusting my focus, I'm getting into knives

I sought wisdom from the sages
Consulted with master tacticians
Met up with some guys who wouldn't tell me their last names
They specialized in non-conventional munitions
Stayed on the scent like a bloodhound
Followed the clues where they led
Taste of hot ashes on my tongue all day
I took my rifle with me to bed

But I'm getting into knives
I'm getting into knives
It's a gift to be simple, it's a gift to be free
I'm adjusting my focus, I'm getting into knives

Held to my vision all these days
While stray signals kept flooding the switchboard
Came all this way for hunger
May I be worthy of my reward
You might also likeI stood at the door and I listened
Rustled through my rucksack as quiet as I could
You can't give me back what you've taken
But you can give me something that's almost as good

I'm getting into knives
I am getting into knives
Behold, I stand at the door and I knock, and then I knock twice
I've adjusted my focus, I'm getting into knives


A dream in switchgrass and concrete
Three grey floors of smoky windows
Facing the street
Michael pulls the blinds back up
Stares blankly at the intersection
Watching for the guy who's got the angel dust
Crystal-clear connection
Days like dominos
All in a line
We cheer for the home team
Every time
Lakeside View
Lakeside View
Lakeside View
For my whole crew
Most nights now, sleep in the kitchen
Keep my face cool on the floor
And John-John comes by to drop off his envelopes
Still playing postman after all these years
Pull down my army surplus jacket
Dig through some drawers to find the keys
Emerge transformed in a million years
From days like these
Under each eye
A little greasepaint smudge
You can't judge us
You're not the judge
Lakeside View
Lakeside View
Lakeside View
For my whole crew
And just before I leave
I throw up in the sink
One whole life recorded
In disappearing ink
And Ray left a message
Thumbtacked to the door
I don't even bother trying to read them anymore

Recite the songs that kept me whole
On the day I hand over command control
Try to let them all flow into this one
List alphabetically
The toxins the doctors found in me
During my time in prison

Count my fingers, every last one
When I get done
Clean the floors well, sweep and swab
Do a thorough job
Leave the old place nicer than I found it
Wish well as the neighbors cheer and shout
Finally taking their earplugs out
Things were even worse here than they sounded

Grim-faced pilots, back from the bombing run
When I get done

Take a picture or two
Just to remember the view
Leave a mark on the door
As an empty warning sign from one who's gone before
But isn't here anymore

Let the crust form on my skin in the sun
When I get done

Sweep the front porch, make it new
Put the broom away when I get through
No passersby need know of my lonely tenure
All this riot of light, the shock of leaves
Wind rippling in my sleeves
Swirling against my skin as in a blender
You might also like
Red thread drying behind me, hand-spun
When I get done


Set food out for the strays
Try hard to do your best
The magpie will have his way
Fill your mouth with berries
By the full light of the moon
Work all night if you have to
The magpie comes at noon
Shore up the crucifixes
Above the archways and the doors
The magpie will come at midday
And you will go down on all fours
And when the cherry's ripe with blossoms
Be ready and be brave
And remember what we had here
When there was something left to save


It's so hard to get revenge
The human element drags you down
Lead a solitary life, if you can
Try not to show your face in town
Let the rumors find such bridges as they may
Reckon up the variables
Find a way

Make it real, make a deal
Until my protector comes
It's so hard to be yourself
When you've already seen the inside
Try to navigate the turns as best you can
Headed on down the slide
Strong friends are where you find them
People talk all kinds of trash, never you mind them

Make it real, make a deal
Until my protector comes

Huge wings blotting out the sun
Remembering everyone

Be so hard to look away
Gotta be strong in the face of suffering
Cut a good figure just in case somebody's watching
Even if it ends up meaning nothing
Let the breezes spread such scandal as they may
Maybe Boris Vallejo paints the back of your head someday

Make it real, make a deal
Until my protector comes


Down on the skylight, where the streetlights
Shine like unquenchable coals
And I’m up high, trying to say goodbye
The only way I know how
Crude and graceless
Peeking through the eyeholes
Seeing the real you
And just after midnight
When it feels like it's getting late
I will reveal you
I will reveal you
Crowd's half-gone, just a few hangers-on
Come to see me finally tear through the stitching at last
And you don't care, you look almost relieved down there
Like you're free, like you can breathe now
Like they've sawn off your cast
Just one more sleeper to see through
And by way of honoring
The things we once both held dear
I will reveal you
I will reveal you
Cast of thousands
But we were the real two
And when I'm alone
Before a mirror late at night
I will reveal you
I will reveal you


The papers write about it back in England
It's practically a lifestyle in Berlin
There's probably some pockets in Ohio
Almost always something happening in Ohio
I heard some bad reports about Long Island
I don't trust what people say about Long Island
I heard some good things from some friends about Chicago
I gotta see with my own eyes about Chicago
We do it different on the West Coast
We do it different on the West Coast
We do it different on the West Coast
We do it different on the West Coast

I heard they had a problem with some skinheads
At a show in a machine shop in Pomona
I feel like half my friends have moved to San Francisco
I think I'm gonna bleach my hair this weekend
And Dave went to New York -- I don't care
You can't shut people up once they get back from their Christmas out there
Skim through such magazines as I can get my hands on
Glue circuit boards to plywood on the weekend
Trellis modulation for the children
There's a whole new world just up around the corner

We do it different on the west coast
We do it different on the west coast
We do it different on the west coast
We do it different on the west coast

We do it different on the west coast
We do it different on the west coast
We do it different on the west coast
We do it different on the west coast


House up in Clearlake
Where I used to live
Picked the lock on the front door
And felt it give
Touch nothing, move nothing, stand still
Keep my ears open for cars
See how the people here live now
Hope that they're better at it than I was

I used to live here
I used to live here
I used to live here
I used to live here
Pictures up on the mantle
Nobody I know
I stand by the tiny furnace
Where the long shadows grow
Living room to bedroom to kitchen
Familiar and warm
Hours spent starving within these walls
Sounds of a distant storm

I used to live here
I used to live here
I used to live here
I used to live here

Fight through the ghosts in the hallway
Duck and weave
Stand by the door with my eyes closed
When it's time to leave
Steal home before sunset
Cover up my tracks
Drive home with old dreams at play in my mind
And the wind at my back
You might also like
Break the lock on my own garden gate
When I get home after dark
Sit looking up at the stars outside
Like teeth in the mouth of a shark

I used to live here
I used to live here
I used to live here
I used to live here


I will rise up early and dress myself up nice
And I will leave the house and check the deadlock twice
And I will find a crowd and blend in for a minute
And I will try to find a little comfort in it
And I will get lonely and gasp for air
And send your name up from my lips like a signal flare

And I will go downtown, stand in the shadows of the buildings
And button up my coat, trying to stay strong, spirit willing
And I will come back home, maybe call some friends
Maybe paint some pictures, it all depends
And I will get lonely and gasp for air
And look up at the high windows, and see your face up there


The clouds explode and then the desert blooms
Someone will need to mop this floor for me
When I emerge, I find my car
Like a cathedral in a dream of the future

Drive til the rain stops
Keep driving

Pull over and blast off when I get the chance
Clear as an insect's wings in the sunlight
Flip on the high stakes radio
Try to sing the words right
Drive til the rain stops
Keep driving

I had his arms tied up behind him
We were together all day
Maybe make Culiacán by sunset
Try to, anyway

High as the clouds now
Flying

Drive til the rain stops
Keep driving


When the house lights all go dark
Shuffle on down to the park
Spent stars in the winter sky
Days of refuge in short supply
All you parasites, climb aboard!
All you vagabonds, praise the Lord!

When the compost pile grows high
Climb to the top if I try
Long-haul truckers still wide awake
Guard their pathways for Jesus' sake
All you garbage trucks, to the curb!
True sons of the Living Word!

Try not to get stuck in the intake vent
Grow fat and grow old and go blind and be content

All you pack dogs, have your say
Let me just find my own way
Moon in the trees my guide
Walk with my jaw hinged wide
Once more unto the breach!
Safe in the spots that the light can't reach


Eastern sun was rising over the mountains
Yellow and blood red bits
Like a kaleidoscope
And flaming swords may guard the Garden of Eden
But we consulted maps from earlier days
Dead languages on our tongues
Holding onto our last hope
And the day was bright and fine
And the highway sign said
"San Bernardino welcomes you"
I checked us into our motel and filled the bathtub
And you got in the warm, warm water
I pulled petals from my pocket
I loved you so much just then
And it was hard but you were brave
You are splendid
And we will never be alone in this world
No matter what they say
We're gonna be okay
We were safe inside
And our new son cried:
"San Bernardino, welcomes you."


Wind out of Oklahoma this morning
Smelled like blood and smoke
And the crows discuss their future in the
Branches of their Louisiana live oak
The limbs are strong and heavy
And its leaves are all aglow
And the branches brush the upper air
But the roots reach down to where the bad people go

And what will I do with you?
Pink and blue
True gold
Nine days old
Nice new clothes on you
And old cardboard produce box for a cradle
I mashed some bananas in a coffee cup
And I fed you there at the kitchen table
Crows outside complaining about the
Finer points of local politics
Strange wind all full of new smells
Rust and fur and reception sticks

And what will I do with you?
Pink and blue
True gold
Nine days old


Watching it go up out front on the lawn
Stay on my feet somehow, I’m strong now
Stuck there, no air
Head high, head high
Tongues of fire that reach up for the sky
Rise through the smoke, the dust of the grave
I will be saved
Pause in mid-stride
Pause in mid-stride
And ride, and ride
And ride, and ride
Burn hard, burn hard
Smoldering pieces landing in the yard
Trace names in ash, big names, old friends
And dead ends
Those last few frames
Go down so fast
Rise through the flames
And end again in flames at last
Stay free, stay free
Invisible armies march by night for me
Stay on my guard, burn hard
Rage on, all gone
Pause in mid-stride
Pause in mid-stride
And ride and ride
And ride and ride


I leave the house as soon as it gets light outside
Like a prisoner breaking out of jail
And I steal down to Business 15-501
Like I had a bounty hunter on my tail
And somebody stops to pick me up
But he drops me off just down the block
And along the highway where the empty spirits breathe
Wild sage growing in the weeds

Walked down the soft shoulder and I count my steps
Heading vaguely eastward, sun in my eyes
And I lose my footing and I skin my hands, breaking my fall
And I laugh to myself and look up at the skies
And then I think I hear angels in my ears
Like marbles being thrown against a mirror
And along the highway, where unlucky stray dogs bleed
Wild sage growing in the weeds
And some days I don't miss my family
And some days I do
And some days I think I'd feel better if I tried harder
Most days I know it's not true

I lay down right where I fell, cold grass in my face
And I hear the traffic like the rhythm of the tides
And I stare at the scrape on the heel of my hand
'Til it doesn't sting so much
And until the blood's dried
And when somebody asks if I'm ok, I don't know what to say
And along the highway, from cast-off, innumerable seeds
Wild sage growing in the weeds


I despise this town
Snow on the sunroof
Two stories down
Hold hands
Wish the snow away
Rise in the darkness
Of the gathering day
Sing
Sing for ourselves alone
Speak into
The microphone
Cedar smudge our headbands
And take to the skies
Soar ever-upwards
On air gone black with flies
Shroud ourselves in the cosmos
Let the music play
Bright star of the morning
Shine on his rising way
Sing
In the night
In the nameless dark
Father long gone
But we bear his mark
Learn some secrets
Never tell
Stay sick
Don't get well
Clutch those broken headboards
Ride the highest wave
Dusky diamonds shining in the far depths of the cave
Try to explain ourselves
Babble on and on
By the time you receive this, we'll be gone
You might also likeSing
Sing high
While the fire climbs
Sing one for the old times


Underneath the sweetgum tree
And the love we once nurtured, you and me
Disintegrating violently
Stick your tongue out
Catch the pieces as they drift down the air
I am too slow to catch them all
Not too far gone to care
Two slow summer hours spent picking at the bones
Figuring the interest on delinquent loans
Speaking in sad and mournful tones
Trying to squeeze tears out of mute stones
Wet your finger, place it toward the wind
Feel disaster in the air
We are far too slow to outrun it now
But not too far gone to care


Something must be done
Jaws dropping at ringside
In the blood tide
When the fireball hits
Down Indiana way
Make 'em check their guns
Real tears when it's over
Smell the sulfur
When the dark vault splits
Lord of the hidden pocket knife
Tawdry dreams all come to life
Save yourselves
Save this town, save everything not nailed down
War in Ontario! Dead before the bell
Crushed hopes of the young breed
All the best bleed
All the proud boys break
Who will stand before the flood?
Who will mop up all the blood?
Who alone?
Skin, bone, steel, stone
Swim or drown
Save this town, save everything not nailed down


Martin calls to say he's sending old electrical equipment
That's good we can always use some more electrical equipment
In the cold clear light of day down here
Everyone's a monster
That's cool with all of us
We've been past the point of help since early April
Susan and her notebook
Freehand drawings of Lon Chaney
Blueprints for geodesic domes
Recipes for cake
Yeah we're all here
Chewing our tongues off
Waiting for the fever to break

When we walk out in the sunlight
We tell everyone we know it hurts our eyes
When the real reason we don't like it
Is that it makes us wonder if we're dying
And Martin's found an old trunk
Full of stage makeup in the basement
And he's sending it along
We can always use more makeup
Yeah more creams and powders
And Carrie's got the feeling
That the people next door
Will close in like a wolf pack
Should we make one small mistake

Yeah we're all here
Chewing our tongues off
Waiting for the fever to break


Sunset on Snohomish
Burn the tree line down
Hold my hopes underwater
Stand there and watch them drown
Fishing out their bodies
From the bathroom sink
Leave them in a bucket
'Til they start to stink

I think I'll stay here
'Til I feel whole again
I don't know when
Trout swim past the fishing lines
Sky gets dark and close
Cars start up and make
Their nightly exodus
On a picnic bench alone
Watch the sky go dark
Dig my nails into my hands
Hope it leaves a mark

I think I'll stay here
'Til I feel whole again
I don't know when


I head north from Toyahvale
Switch to 285 in Pecos
Head up to Red Bluff
My walk's real steady and my eyes are real cold
But I feel like I'm all of 16 years old
Lost in the Travelodge with the television on with the sound down
I don't feel so tough
Old issues of Sunset magazine to read
Sleep for twelve hours and dream about home
I have no place to go
So I drive up to New Mexico
Fix my eyes in the rear view
When I cross the state line
And I panic, I guess, and although it's quite late
I take the first exit to 128
I am coming back to Midland
And I hope you won't mind
Polaroids of the two of us
Scattered on the passenger seat
I drive slowly and evenly
And I dream about home


Incoherent but functional
Speeding like a dead comet
Purple crushed velvet waistcoat
Flecked with Maalox and bits of dried vomit
Say what you will for the effort
You can't fault the technique
Still conscious at sunrise
For the third time this week
But when the blue lights flash
I know we're going to crash
And outside it's ninety-two degrees
And KROQ is playing Siouxsie and the Banshees

Blaupunkt in the dashboard
Cracks in the cylinder block
Heading up the Golden State freeway
Toward Eagle Rock
Ice chest full of Corona
And Pineapple Crush
It'll take twenty years for the toxins to flush
And when the sirens wail
I know we're going to jail

And outside it's ninety two degrees
And KROQ is playing Siouxsie and the Banshees

Follow the flame to freedom
The flickering lights of armageddon
Find the foot of the land way down in the pit
Keep climbing forever
Trying to keep the torch lit

Here at a truck stop in New Mexico
Just before dawn
Somebody's grandma behind the wheel ofabig rig
Pulling inwith her headlights on
We smoke acigarette as the sunrise runs riot
Someone's got to break thequiet
Shesays,"What are youdoing here anyway?"
AndI smile and say, "You'd never guess"
She holds it up for me by its skinny white shoulder straps
Well I, I take a picture of my dress
I take a picture of my dress
I'm in the bathroom of a Dallas, Texas Burger King
And Mr. Steven Tyler is on the overhead speaker
He doesn't want to miss a thing
Out there at the counter
Blending in with the lunchtime crowd
Trying not to laugh out loud
I eat half my crispy chicken club
I get extra mayonnaise, it's a mess
I take the other half out to the parking lot with me
Pop the trunk and take a picture of my dress
I take a picture of my dress

It still looks good
I only wore it once
Nine years ago
Nine years and seven months

It may be a long while before the highway
Decides to finally set me free
I'm going to have to chase down the remnants
Of something special that you stole from me
It may be hiding in the sunset or in distant corners of the dawn
Or maybe it's gone
You might also likeBut I say some prayers above the engine
I bless everything there is to bless
Run out of gas in the middle of nowhere anyway
Stand by the roadside smiling

And take a picture of my dress

I take a picture of my dress
I take a picture of my dress


When I worked down at the liquor store
Guy with a shotgun came raging through the place
Muscled his way behind the counter
I shot him in the face

This morning I went down to the Catholic church
Cause something just came over me
Forty-five minutes in the pews
Praying the rosary
When the last days come
We shall see visions
More vivid than sunsets
Brighter than stars
We will recognize each other
And see ourselves for the first time
The way we really are

Decorative grating on my window
Gets a little rustier every year
I don't know how the metal gets rusty
When it never rains here

A year or so ago I worked at a liquor store
And a guy came in
Tried to kill me, so I shot him in the face
I would do it again, I would do it again

When the last days come
We shall see visions
More vivid than sunsets
Brighter than stars
We will recognize each other
And see ourselves for the first time
The way we really are


Cops and robbers, strictly bargain line
Spent the wet night tracking visions through the pines
Draw my arms into my hospital gown
See the sky open and rain down
Rain down

Mercy for the Diaz brothers
Mercy for the Diaz brothers
Hear my rivals on the western wind
Hard to know who might or might not be your friend
Work by the Plutonian light
Forbidden rosary prayers all night
All night

Mercy for the Diaz brothers
Mercy for the Diaz brothers

Beam of the flash-light
All night in the woods
Hunt us like dogs
And then string us up for good

Keep one step ahead of enemies
Foretell worse things than such frightful nights as these
Lead us to the beach by our hands
And bury us there in the sand

Mercy for the Diaz brothers
Mercy for the Diaz brothers
Mercy for the Diaz brothers
Mercy for the Diaz brothers


Fans all spread out, neat and clean
Grab hold of the morning, head out to the porch
Feel the wind stopping, feel the sun scorch
I fear for my safety, you can see it in my eyes
In an hour or two, we will rise
Then a sharp breeze kicks up
I hug myself hard
How come there's peacocks in the front yard?
Sun's all prickly on my neck
When the helicopter passes, we both hit the deck
Hands grasping and groping
Seizing opportunity right where it lies
The sky will fall, we will rise


In these times of wanting prophesy
And false witnesses up to all manner of deviltry
Drench a kitchen rag in heretic's blood
Wash your windows and prepare for the flood

Look to the West
Look to the man bearing the Sicilian crest

Portents in the sky say that the time is near
Dial into the signal, coming in loud and clear
Sacrificial victims out of the cage
Smiling as they're taking the stage
Look to the West
Look to the man bearing the Sicilian crest

Out of the blue, everything's new
All the talk we heard was true
The legends we all heard once
The whispers from the storefronts

Hope for the best
Prepare for the worst
We wait like stock-piled landmines, ready to burst
Wait all your life to see what you see
Open up your eyes and be free

Look to the West
Look to the man bearing the Sicilian crest


The path to the awful room that no one will sleep in again
Was lit for one man only, gone where none can follow him
Try to look down the way he had gone
Back of the closet whose depths go on and on and on

And nice people said he was with God now
Safe in his arms
But the voices of the angels that he heard on his last days with us
Smoke alarms
Well, the path to the palace of wisdom that the mystics walk
Is lined with neuroleptics and electric shocks
Hope daily for healing, try not to go insane
Dance in a circle with bells on, try to make it rain

And nice people say he had gone home to God now
Safe in his arms, safe in his arms
But the voices of the angels singing to him in his last hours with us
Smoke alarms, smoke alarms


When I'm old, when I'm old
Haul the wrecks down to the wreck yard
Help the boys unload
Keep my hair nice and long
Because I can, because I can
Any of my old friends who have no place to turn to
They know to call me any time they come through
Never die, never die
Stand with a bullwhip in my hand
And rise, rise
In the desert sand
Work days, work nights
Finally get laid up
By a piece of broken glass
On the floor of the shop
And the doctor recognizes me
As the operating theater goes dim
Aren't you that old wrestler with the bullwhip?
Yes sir, that's me, I'm him
Get around fine on one leg
Lose a kidney, then go blind
Sit on my porch in Houston
Let the good times dance across my mind
Never die, never die
Stand with a bullwhip in my hand
And rise, rise
Surrounded by friends


'Til the fullness of the frame is clear and plain
Peer into the screen until you see it all
Like a vision in a crystal ball
Let it all fill with smoke
Is this somebody's idea of a joke?
Let the fixer work until the silver's washed away
And take the picture from the tray
Look hard at what you see and then remember you and me
And let the truth spring free
Like a jack-in-the-box
Like a hundred-thousand cuckoo clocks
From the Oregon corners to the Iowa corn
To the rooms with the heat lamps where the snakes get born
Crawl through the tunnel and follow, follow the light northwest
See that young man who dwells inside his body like an uninvited guest
See the tunnel twist
Clutch your birthright in your fist
Let the camera do its dirty work down there in the dark
Sink low, rise high
Bring back some blurry pictures to remember all your darker moments by
Permanent bruises on our knees
Never forget what it felt like to live in rooms like these
From the California coastline to the Iowa corn
To the rooms with the heat lamps where the snakes get born


Stayed up late and wrecked this place
Woke up on the floor again
Cellphone stuck to the side of my face
Dead space on the other end
Perfect howl of emptiness
Cast my gaze around the room
Someone needs to clean up this mess
Tape up the windows
Call in a favor from an old friend
Make some scratches on my floor
Crawl down on my hands and knees
In old movies people scream
Choking on their fists when they see shadows like these
But no one screams cause it's just me
Locked up in myself
Never gonna get free
Something sacred, something blue
Cannons in the harbor dawn
I crawled down here to dig for bones
One more season then I'm gone
Black drapes over the crosses
Call in a favor from an old friend


As we cruised across the Canadian border
You reached into your handbag and puled out a micro-cassette recorder
Started quoting Tolstoy into the machine, I had no idea what you meant
Guess I'm supposed to figure these things out, or maybe it's supposed to be self-evident
But I've gone feral, and I don't speak the language anymore
We're heading deep into the forest, I've got the pedal to the floor
The engine shudders like a dying man
When you reach out to grab my hand

You can bring out all your weapons
You can't make me go to war
Long winding Canadian highways; innumerable Evergreens
Weather forecast on the AM radio says we'll be expecting highs in the low 'teens
While I mouth my silent curses at you, I can see my breath
I hope the stars don't even come out tonight, I hope we both freeze to death
Look at the person I've turned into, tell me, how do you like him now?
No standards of any kind to break, no creeds to disavow
I am right here where you want me
Do what you brought me out here for

You can arm me to the teeth
You can't make me go to war!


We who train in the way of the blade
We who sleep in the accursed glade
We come before you now
We come before you now

We who in his favor would stand
Who lovingly await his most fearsome command
We come before you now
We come before you now
Cut loose the handcuffs
Let him go free

We who travel by starlight
We who slipped past your guards in the night
We come before you now
We come before you now

We who boldly lay claim to our own
We who've seen the chamber of the one true throne

We who've seen the kindness of the cracks of his face
We who will die if we must in this place
We've come before you, outnumbered and unafraid
Well-trained in the way of the blade

Cut loose the handcuffs
Let him go free
Let him go free
Let him go free
Let him go free


Jonah went down to the docks
To flee from the wrath of the Lord
But the mark on his forehead
Was visible to everybody on board

They threw him down into the water
But he did not drown
I'm on a balcony in Mobile, Alabama
Waiting for the wind to throw me down
Now the Lord told the great fish
Be free of your burden
And Jonah emerged from his darkness
Like a dancer crashing through the curtain

And the plant grew but it withered
And it shriveled up and turned brown
I’m on a balcony in Mobile, Alabama
Waiting for the wind to throw me down

Lord, if you won't keep me safe and warm
Then send down the storm
Send down the storm

Jonah was sure he heard voices
Maybe just one voice but real clear
And where he went, the voice followed
Sometimes hardly loud enough to hear

“Shall I not spare the wise with the wicked?
Hold back my wrath from this town?”
I'm on a balcony in Mobile, Alabama
Waiting for the wind to throw me down
You might also like
May I address the foreman of the jury?
Why do you hold back your fury?
Don’t hold back your fury


I am ready for my closeup today
Too long I've let my self respect stand in my way
Well, the prom queen's
Caught in the high beams
And the strings keen
It's a big scene

But when the house goes up in flames
No one emerges triumphantly from it
When the scum begins to circle the drain
Everybody loves a winner
I spent eight hours in my makeup chair
Waxed my chest and shaved off all my hair
Well, the fire's bright
And the frame's tight
Try to get right
While we've still got light

But when the house goes up in flames
No one emerges triumphantly from it
When the scum begins to circle the drain
Everybody loves a winner

But when the house goes up in flames
When the scum begins to circle the drain


I found an old rock in the dry dirt outside
The door of my motel room
It was a triangle with soft, rounded edges
And a split down the middle of one corner
It was darker than English moss
Green like the soft frills of a peacock's plume

I waited for you
But I never told you where I was
It was you who taught me how
To write these kinds of equations
I waited on the steps for you
And I hid in the bushes whenever a car pulled into the parking lot
You taught me how
To listen to these
Distant stations
Distant stations
I saw the sky break
I threw a rock at a crow who was playing in the mulch of some rosebushes by the motel office
Missed him by a good yard or two
I sang old songs from nowhere
Los Angeles, Albuquerque
I said a small prayer for the poor and the naked and the hungry
And I prayed real hard for you

I waited for you
But I never told you where I was
It was you who taught me how
To write this kind of equation
I waited on the steps for you
And I hid in the bushes whenever I saw a car pull into the parking lot
You taught me how
To listen to these
Distant stations
Distant stations


Condemned to walk the soil amongst all creatures wild and tame
Go where I go, do what I must
Crawl, starving, on my belly, licking up the dry dust
I see the light in your window
Ride the elevator to the sixth floor
Stand with my arms at my sides
As you open up the door

But I'm out of my element
I can't breathe
I'm out of my element
I can't breathe
Alone with your bathroom mirror, try to get my head straight
Breathe on the glass and wait for it to clear, clean slate
Meet up with you in the kitchen where the air is hot and dry
Open up all the faucets, be fruitful and multiply
I stand where
The flashing swords gleam
And I try to shake my head
Clear of the dream

But I'm out of my element
I can't breathe
I'm out of my element
I can't breathe
I start to sweat, I can't cool down
I'm scared of all the strangers in this town
I try to tell you just why I've come
It's like I've got molasses on my tongue
I made it through town somehow
But who's gonna save me now?

I'm out of my element
I can't breathe
I'm out of my element
I can't breathe


Crusty boots in the corner of the closet
By the tackle box
Once proud shining silver buckles
Safe behind the normalcy locks
Baubles and bangles
A lost age
Still all aglow with the radiance of the stage
That's who I was (that's who I was)
This is who I am (this is who I am)
Work to pay down the interest
On the mortgage
Used to get paid by the gram
Long Beach
Long Beach can you hear me?
Can you hear me Long Beach?

Long Beach can you hear me?

Master tape from the show we did at Fender's
Back in '85
Dark paisley from Retail Slut
All four of us still fresh and alive
Flashes and phosphenes
It's hard to believe that's me
Strapped in and visibly sweating
As happy as I'm ever gonna be
You're by my side (you're by my side)
Five years left on your collar (five years on your collar)
You're cashing out
All dressed up
For your date with the emergency ward

Long Beach
Long Beach can you hear me?
Can you hear me Long Beach?
Long Beach
Long Beach can you hear me?
Can you hear me Long Beach?


Look closely at the shadows
On the ground beneath the trees
The labors of Hercules
Wild grasses onthehills
Rippling in thewind
Cybele unchained

The songs you sing atChristmas time
The stories that you tell
Well I knew them well
YesIknewthem well
Say yourprayers to whomever
Youcall out to in the night
Keep the chains tight
Make it through this year
If it kills you outright

The coins they toss at dancers
Whirling in the city square
Music on the air
The places where we met to share
Our secrets now and then
We will see them again
Change will come
Stay warm inside the ripple
Of the Panasonic hum
It grinds
And it roars
Headed somewhere better
If I have to crawl there on all fours

Say your prayers to whomever
You call out to in the night
Keep the chains tight
Make it through this year
If it kills us outright


Boats ease into the harbor bearing real suspicious cargo
And the sunlight on the water sets a switch off in your brain
The things that you've got coming will consume you
There's someone waiting out there in an alley with a chain

The ghosts that haunt your building are prepared to take on substance
And the dull pain that you live with isn't getting any duller
There's a closet full of almost pristine videotape
Documenting sordid little scenes in living color
Here they come
The young thousands
Here they come
The young thousands

You drive east from the ocean with both hands tied on the wheel
And you go past Garden Grove as the pleasure index rises
The things that you've got coming will do things that you're afraid to
There is someone waiting out there with a mouthful of surprises
The ghosts that haunt your building have been learning how to breathe
They scan the hallways nightly vainly searching for a sign
There must be diamonds somewhere in a place that stinks this bad
There are brighter things than diamonds coming down the line

Here they come
The young thousands
Here they come
The young thousands


Write something down in illegible script
As we're approaching the landing strip
New Gibson SG, inlaid with pearl
Tonight, Passaic; tomorrow, the world
In a Holiday Inn by a nameless river
Renew the assault on my lungs and my liver
And while I’m waiting for the company man
Slip on my kimono that I bought in Japan

Tell the crowd, tell the world
I want everyone to get high
Tell the press, tell the cameras
I want everyone to get high
And the tech crew in Memphis has a present for me
A screen that scrolls lyrics
Like the ones they have on TV
The deluxe model
One of only four thousand made
Black out that night in front of ten thousand paid
In the back lounge, in between stops
Contingency plans in case the new one flops
Sometimes I wake up coughing up blood
Tonight, Indianapolis; tomorrow, the flood

Tell the person next to you
I want everyone to get high
Tell your boss, tell your mother
I want everyone to get high
Get high


And it kept me awake
It was still falling by morning
It was hard to take
And you were sleeping on the floor
Breathing free and even
If I ever want to drive myself insane
All I have to do is watch you breathing
And at 5 AM
I turned the radio on
And an old man's voice
Sang a short, sweet song
And then the static roared again
Hungry for blood
I heard the rain falling from the rain spout
Down, down into the sweet wet mud
And you punched out all the windows
And the wind began to wail
And you gathered your hair behind your head
Like God was gonna catch you by the ponytail
And then the old voice crackled through the static
And I felt young and alive
And the hairs stood up on the back of my neck
We were rising from the grave
Yeah, yeah


They're going to find intelligent life up there on the moon
And The Canterbury Tales will shoot up to the top of the bestseller list
And stay there for twenty-seven weeks

And the Chicago Cubs will beat every team in the league
And the Tampa Bay Bucs will make it all the way through January
And I will love you again
I will love you, like I used to
I will love you again
I will love you, like I used to
The stars are going to spell out the answers to tomorrow's crossword
And the Philips Corporation will admit that they've made an awful mistake
And Bill Gates will single-handedly spearhead the Heaven 17 revival

And the Chicago Cubs will beat every team in the league
And the Tampa Bay Bucs will take it all the way to the top
And I will love you again
I will love you, like I used to
I will love you again
I will love you, like I used to


Steal away at sundown, pick a place to hide
Check for signs of ambush, hunker down inside
Tired of running, tired of never standing still
Hear them riding up the hill

Men whose ribs are showing through their skin
Bringing up the rear
It’s high noon somewhere
It’s dark in here
Stack my ammunition, be ready when you come
You who thirst for action, I will give you some
When the smoke dies down, you can rest assured
We will know who kept his word

You who stood so proud once
I can taste your fear
You blazed like torches
It’s dark in here

It’s dark as a coal mine filling up with gas
I stand ready for the blast

Will you be ready when your moment comes?
Will your hands be steady when you reach down for your guns?
Did you leave your house in order when you came for me?
Is this really where you meant to be?

Just beyond your limits
Find the new frontier
I live in the darkness
It’s dark in here


So it's totally unreadable
Drinking the dregs
Eating the utterly inedible
We do what we do
All for you
All dressed up
Black hat and white cane
Slowly circling the drain
Ready for the future
Ready for the world about to come
Shooting the sequel before the treatment's even finished
Sanding numbers off the Monojects
As our slight returns diminish
We are what we are
Get in the goddamn car
Smiling faces flawlessly rehearsed
We are sleek and beautiful
We are cursed
Ready for the future
Ready for the world about to come


Pull my mask so tight
'Til it pinches my skin
Nerves strung so high
I am a mandolin
Jenny calls from Montana
She's only passing through
Probably never see her again in this life, I guess
Not sure what I'm gonna do

Plug a night light in
Leave the porch light on
Because the small, dark corners
Have designs on me
Live like an outlaw
Clutching gold coins in his claw
Room full of ambitious young policemen
Everybody trying to make his mark
I was a red dot blinking on a screen up overhead
And then, the room went dark
Dream of maybe waking up someday
And wanting you less than I do
This is a dream, though
It's never gonna come true

Plug a night light in
Leave the porch light on
Because the small, dark corners
Are establishing a colony
Live like an outlaw
Clutching gold coins in his claw

Can't ever set aside the sweetness
Of the days before the crews put up the border
Fields full of wet rain
Cling tight to their memory forever
Think about Montana when I close my eyes
Possibly, Jenny's headed east
Count a couple of stray hopes out loud
May their numbers one day be increased

Look in the cellar where the cinders blaze
Sift through the shadows for days
Look in the corners, but you can't see me
You can't see me I'm free

I'm gonna burn it all down today
Down today, okay
I'm gonna burn it all down today
And sweep all the ashes away
Count up the keepsakes in the cabinets
The keyboards and the chemistry sets
Look in the attic where the blinds are drawn
You won't find me I'm gone

I'm gonna burn it all down today
Down today, okay
I'm gonna burn it all down today
And sweep all the ashes away

Etch an outline on your heart
I'm gonna blow the whole circus apart

Reckon the remnants when they land at last
The shattered aftermath of the blast
Look for me everywhere the burn marks form
Trying to find a place to keep warm

I'm gonna burn it all down today
Down today, okay
I'm gonna burn it all down today
And sweep all the ashes away
I'm gonna burn it all down today
Down today, okay
I'm gonna burn it all down today

Keep a line out to the people who take the long view

But I may one day

Here we come scrubbed and scoured
Patches on our jeans
When the drone sounds
In the cool night wind
We pick up the call
Kick all the traces in
Hungry for love
Ready to drown
So tie down the sails
We're going downtown
Great big drain on the power grid
You may not like Tate's methods
But you've got to admit
She's a real nice kid
We walk light
Down the wires
Higher than weather balloons
Empty hearts on fire
Hungry for love
Ready to drown
So tie down the sails tonight
We're going downtown


Alright, well. I had a tracked version of this that was all ready to master,andthen it turnedout there was a mysterious seven-and-a-half-secondgap in the other one. All hail the mysterious gap!

Go through the motions
Every day out in the square
Listen for the hidden rhythms on the air
Nod in agreement when the tyrant holds forth
Look for a beacon from the North
Protect yourself
Vouch for every member of the team
This is just a momentary ripple in the stream
Join in the rebuilding
Sing loudly at your labor
Make friends with the new guys
Be nice to your neighbor
Profess keen interest in the welfare of the state
Taste everything they feed you
Say it tastes real great
Spit it down your sleeve
Every time you get the chance
This is just a brief improvisation in the dance

Raise up the columns
Take the statues down
Praise the columns
Spread the word around town

Behold the temple where the old one stood
Is it not a thing of beauty
Don't it make you feel good?
Is it not a big improvement on the way things used to be?
Is it not a stately beacon for the whole world to see?
You might also likeWe will be right here
On the day it finally burns
Everybody hold a spot
Until Olympius returns
Yeah!


When I get home bury them again
Wonder if you'll ever get the chance
To ask me why I turned you in
I saved my own skin but I live to fight
I live to fight another day
Still remember how brave you were
When they came to take you away

And I feel guilty
But I can't feel ashamed
Prowl through empty fields
Great Cain
Thought I'd seen a ghost up on the boulevard
Between the broken bits
It's hard to tell gifts of the spirit
From clever counterfeits
Sleepwalk through my days
And mark the hours until these dark times fade
Like a caterpillar crawling out
Along the surface of the blade

And I feel guilty
But I can't feel ashamed
Prowl through empty fields
Great Cain
Rummage through the gutted storehouse now
And lick the sweat from my brow
Saw the trucks roll out this morning
Not sure when they're coming back again
Feel the prickings of my conscience in my chest
Every now and then
Sometimes a great wave of forgetfulness
Rises up and blesses me
And other times the sickness howls
And I despair of any remedy
You might also like
And I feel guilty
But I can't feel ashamed
Prowl through empty fields
Great Cain


The day I turned my back on all you people
I felt an itching in my thumbs
The salt air like a broadcast from the distant, dark beyond
When my transformation comes

I went down to the warm, warm water
Saw a pelican fly past
Waved once at the highway and then left all that behind me
I went wading through the grass
And no one was gonna come and get me
There wasn't anybody gonna know
Even though I leave a trail of burnt things in my wake
Every single place I go

And it was cool, and it was quiet
In the humid marsh down there
I let my head sink down beneath the brackish water
Felt it gumming up my hair

The sun was sinking into the Atlantic
The last time that I turned my back on you
I tried to summon up a little prayer as I went under
It was the best that I could do

And I said
"Let them all fare better than your servant"
The reeds all pricking at my skin
"Here's hoping they have better luck than I had down here with you"
All that water rushing in


Will I see you there when that final trumpet blows?
If I don't see you there, I will run a comb through my hair
And I will wait, I will wait, I will wait
Will you walk on in when the angel summons you?
Will you walk on in when the angel summons you?
If I don't see you go, I will let the minions flow
And I will wait, I will wait, I will wait
Down in Dealey Plaza, the tourists mill about
Down in Dealey Plaza, the tourists mill about
And I am far from where we live
And I have not learned how to forgive
But I will wait, I will wait, I will wait
Yeah


Stay true to the path young Jedi
Cleave to the precepts you’ve been given
Remember those who went before and cleared a way for you
Let your deeds give hope and comfort to the living
Let your deeds give hope and comfort to the living

Do your best in city or in swampland
Peace over anger, honor over hate
At the end of all your days one Jedi waits for you
With the dust of Jedi bones piled high like parsnips on his plate
With the dust of Jedi bones piled up like parsnips on his plate
Specifically just their bones, all the soft parts you can keep
It’s the bones that have the calcium, so he says
The long feast will be filmed for mass consumption
The cameras Rian’s got these days are unimaginably hi-res

Despair not for the end that waits for you
Fear not the fire in which your flesh must burn
All the Jedi from all the planets in this putrid universe
Get eaten by this last one, now it’s your turn
They get eaten by this last one and now it’s your turn

Bones bones bones bones bones
Bones bones bones bones bones

The ultimate Jedi, who wastes all the other Jedi
Has eaten up all their bones
All their bones bones bones bones bones


Long dinner with some friends
Way out way out in Portmore
Servants of the pharaoh
Slip in through the open door
All business
Bearing knives and zip-guns
So get on the floor now every last one
Every last one

The heat drifts across the land
If I forget you Israel
Let me forget my right hand
And on the floor Michael James Williams
Feels his fingers start to freeze
And the whole scene's like a movie
Paramedics on their knees
Try try your whole life
To be righteous and be good
Wind up on your own floor
Choking on blood

The heat drifts across the land
If I forget you Israel
Let me forget my right hand

And the house still smells like onions
When the ambulance arrives
Gabriel in postal blue
Loads up the car and drives to Spanish Town
About three miles away
Where will the wicked run to on that last day?

The heat drifts across the land
If I forget you Israel
Let me forget my right hand


There's the part you've braced yourself against, and then
There's the other part
Steal up inclining northward streets with some
Weird sickness in the dark
Saw your name on the sidewalk
Saw your brave face in my mind
If you're gonna sit next to the dealer
You get to bet blind
Never get away, never get away
I am never, ever gonna get away from this place
Laid out on the street, my eyes toward the sun
Your star next to my face

The compasses I came into this world with
Never really worked so good
Gentle shadows spilling down the hills
Up on Mulholland at Ledgewood
Turn back, turn back
Find someone to tell your secrets to
Dream past an old hotel on Ivy
And seconds later, I saw you

Never get away, never get away
I am never, ever gonna get away from this place
Laid out on the street, my eyes toward the sun
Your star next to my face

Let the camera track me
From the footlights to the wings
Let me set aside an hour or two
In memory of sweet things
You might also likeRegrind the lens again and again and again and again
But still the picture flips
Anyone here mentions "Hotel California" dies before
The first line clears his lips

Never get away, never get away
I am never, ever gonna get away from this place
Laid out on the street, my eyes toward the sun
Your star next to my face


Hustle up the spiral stairs
See if anyone’s left up there
Teams on the scene from several stations
Everybody adjust your expectations
Stray clumps of hair and blood and brain
Fragments of bone in the drain
Rookies trying to keep the airway clear
But the damage is too severe

Bring in the cadaver sniffing dog
Bring in the cadaver sniffing dog
Bring in the cadaver (Bring in the cadaver)
Sniffing dog
Bring in the cadaver (Bring in the cadaver)
Sniffing dog

Army crawlers down ash-wet floor
Ready for war
Veterans on their hands and knees
Nobody's ready for days like these
Wait 'til you come up on the smoking wreck
And even then, you check
Radio home, all clean
If there were any survivors they've fled the scene

Bring in the cadaver sniffing dog
Bring in the cadaver sniffing dog
Bring in the cadaver (Bring in the cadaver)
Sniffing dog
Bring in the cadaver (Bring in the cadaver)
Sniffing dog


The room was dark and it smelled like sulfur
I heard the screams from way down in the darkness
Felt pretty sure my life was over
I kept my hat on just for luck
Sang simple tunes the whole night through
I wondered if I'd wake to find myself in flames
As I waited here for you
Yeah when you came in
I could breathe again
I saw some guys dressed up like sorcerers
Blue robes that flowed above the ground
They came and went and I was frightened for my life
I tried not to make a sound
Just when my solitude was closing in
I heard a howl like screeching tires
And I told you the one thing I know how to say
Through the bright ringing drone of eight-bit choirs

Yeah when you came in
I could breathe again


When stray dogs finally catch you in the alley
You don’t consider their point of view
Butwhenthe wounds arehealed and the scars are shiny
Sometimesthen you do

The terms are vicious
Time is tight
No one gets
Too much light
When you see the risen beast in your nightmares
You treat him like a long-lost brother
But when you pass him on the streets of the city by day
You pretend you don’t recognize each other

The lake is boiling
The fish won't bite
No one gets
Too much light

Seek out a cave by the ocean while you wait out the rain
Dial down the weak bits and crank up the gain
Listen for the prophecy somewhere in the static
Once you've saddled up your pony, burn down the paddock

When pigs gather in the sty to greet the sunrise
They all begin to squeal for joy
It doesn't sound like joy to the untrained ear
And there's plenty of distortion and it's not real clear

You've got a friend downstairs
He howls all night
No one gets
Too much light


This house is so haunted
With dead men
I can't lose

I was having visions of sugared pastry
Cooked up in clarified butter
I tried to turn my visions into prayers
But I built my castle way high up in the air
Yeah, I came to the gates of the fabled pink city
Hungry and tired and cold
Swing low, sweet chariot
Chrome tailpipe shining bright as spun gold

My brothers picked me up out of the rushes
Handed me into the company of evil men
But I inched my way down the eastern seaboard
I am coming to Atlanta again

Yeah I came to the gates of the fabled pink city
Hungry, and tired, and mad as all hell
Swing low sweet jewel-encrusted chariot
Make me young again; make me well

I am the killer dressed in pilgrim's clothing
I am the hard-to-find stations on the AM band
I am the white sky high over Tripoli
I am the landmine hidden in the sand

Yeah I came to the gates of the fabled pink city
Hungry and tired and alone
Swing low, sweet, sweet, sweet chariot
Coming forth to carry me home


Set the spectrum for the greyscale; that's better
Favorite bold fonts in blackletter
Star-crossed lovers and their tragic fates
And that one Celtic Frost record
Almost everybody hates

Candlelight playing its tricks
On the walls of the cave
Hauling these songs to the light
From the mouth of the grave
Mark the map out for the treasure; don't say where
Find the octave in the shadow and stay there
Sleep till sunset, stay up late
Bleed bile all night
Into an SM58

Candlelight playing its tricks
On the walls of the cave
Hauling these songs to the light
From the mouth of the grave

Finally head west but it's a dead end
Come home dead broke but still among friends
Keep what's precious; drop what's not
Without a second thought
There's not so many of us
But you don't know any of us
Work like a gravedigger, let the blood spill
Headline really big festivals
Every other summer in Brazil

Candlelight playing its tricks
On the walls of the cave
Hauling these songs to the light
From the mouth of the grave


This is called "Aulon Raid"

Come riding with your soldiers
See how they fare
Keep yourself out oftheaction
Arrows flying throughthe air
Your reputation precedes you
Something mustbe done
Here in the heat of the onslaught
I am theone
Meandmy crew
We willdeal with you
Wewill deal with you
Me and my pagan crew

Come to lay down the edict
Come for the spoils
Come for the temple attendants
Anointed in oils
Come flanked by your big guns
Ride with the packs
Come screaming for tribute
Go out on your back

Me and my crew
We will deal with you
We will deal with you
Me and my pagan crew, yeah, yeah


Close the balcony at the Rainbow
Because the promoter says so
Aviators and a buckskin frontier hat
How come they dress like that?
They break the news to me so gentle
But I start to feel sentimental
This used to be the place to go
Still draw pretty good in Ontario

Nobody wants to hear the twelve bar blues
From a guy in platform shoes
Let's just have a good time when the show's done
Ask where the good clubs are and go find one
Roll up to the curb
Spill out of the car
Everyone's dressed up like corpses
I brought my guitar
Set it down by the stage
The singer's locked up in a steel cage
Shaking the bars
Eyes wild with fear
I don't belong here

Nobody wants to hear the twelve bar blues
From a guy in platform shoes


Wheels down in Seattle
Three years ago, in this town
They sent their best and brightest to me
I sent them all back down

Deluxe coach to the ballpark
There's champagne on the snack trays
Summon up the spirit of a brighter time
Looked bad last week against the Blue Jays
When my name was everywhere
None of you were there
When my name was everywhere

Potholes in the parking lot
You feel the jolts a little harder every year
The batboy hands out yellow slickers
It never stops raining out here

When my name was everywhere
None of you were there
When my name was everywhere

When the speedball would squeal
With the highlight reel
When the headline hype
Was on the front page in extra-large type
It was me, for all the world to see

Don’t call it a comeback
I've been here for years
Maximum respect to all the warriors
Who choose to fall down on their spears
You might also like
When my name was everywhere
None of you were there
When my name was everywhere


You were born for these flashing lights
You were born for these endless nights
You always knewsooneror later
You weredestined for something greater

To get the pieceofthepie that belongedto you
You've beenwaiting for this ever since you were young
Be careful not to choke on your tongue
Get famous
You should be famous
Go on and get famous
I want you to be famous

Cold grey world, all these obedient sheep
They act like they know but they're all sound asleep
Waiting for something to wake up to
Some nice juicy bone to chew
You arrive on the scene like a message from God
Listen to the people applaud
This is what you were born to do
Wesley Willis taught me how to write about you

Get famous
You should be famous
You go on and get famous
I want you to be famous

Light up the sky like a comet
Make yourself want to vomit
Shine like a cursed star
Show everybody exactly who you are

Crude little wooden idols and aviator shades
The trinkets and the treasures we brought back from the Crusades
Some guy in an Impala shakes his head when he rides by
But I remember when we shared a vision, you and I

Worked hard to build this altar—we made it earn its keep
The cracks across its surface spiderweb while we're asleep
The sacrificial stains all spreading out and soaking through
But I remember when we kept it pretty, me and you
And high above the water
The eagle spots the fish
Every martyr in this jungle
Is gonna get his wish

Stock shots, stupid stock shots from the Pomona Mall
Set up like unloved icons, gathering dust upon the wall
From films no one remembers, they call down silently
But I remember when their names were dear to you and me
Yeah

Pennies on the dollar, everything's gotta go
The things that we can't even give away—I don't wanna know
Try to see if secrets burn when you hold them up into the light
I remember when we loved each other day and night

And high above the water
The eagle spots the fish
Every martyr in this jungle
Is gonna get his wish


As the heat stole power from the darkening light
I saw the streets fill up with people that I knew
People who looked like you
Rise if you're sleeping, stay awake
We are young supernovas, and the heat's about to break
Drift through the streets, walk between the cars
Newborn sons and daughters spat forth from distant stars
The summer will reveal itself to those whose hearts are true
And to the faithless few
Rise if you're sleeping, stay awake
We are young supernovas, and the heat's about to break
Who will rise and who will sink?
Who's going to stand his ground, and who's going to blink?
Surge forward from Van Cortlandt Park, like frightened sheep
Spirit throngs that hoist us high, three thousand warriors deep
Spray our dreams on any surface where the paint will stick
Try to time the rhythm, listen for the click
Rise if you're sleeping, stay awake
We are young supernovas, and the heat's about to break


A bad dream shook me in my sleep and I woke up sweating
Ran through the dark to the shower, already forgetting
Tried to think good thoughts, trying to find my way clear
Let the room fill with steam, traced pictures on the mirror

Ghosts and clouds and nameless things
Squint your eyes and hope real hard
Maybe sprout wings
I clawed my way to the living room window, stood there in the cold
The last bits of my dream like figures in the distance, hard to hold
I thought of old friends, the ones who'd gone missing
Said all their names three times, phantoms in the early dark
Canaries in the mines

Ghosts and clouds and nameless things
Squint your eyes and hope real hard
Maybe sprout wings


If the strain proves too much
Give up right away
If the light hurts your eyes
Stay in your room all day

When the room fills with smoke
Lie down on the floor
In the declining years
Of the long war
Well the blood’s in the water
And the shark’s gonna come
And we swim in the dark
Until our bodies are numb

Blind desert rats in the moonlight
Too far from shore
In the declining years
Of the long war

Empty room with a lightbulb
Where the phone starts to ring
Everybody gets nervous
Nobody says anything

The next day someone’s initials
Show up on the door
I think I’m gonna crack
Can’t live like this anymore

Ugly things in the darkness
Worse things in store
In the declining years
Of the long war


Red sun high in the sky tonight
Look west from London, down toward Hollywood
Remember the first days in California
You don't wanna see these guys without their masks on
You don't wanna see these guys without their masks on
Fat rich men love their twelve-year-olds
Deco cufflinks and cognac by the glass
Look west from London, toward the Emerald City
Remember Minnesota
You don't wanna see these guys without their masks on
You don't wanna see these guys without their masks on, or their gloves
Sweet spearmint and bitter tangerine
Bedside decked with roses
Look west, look west, look west, and look away
From old, familiar faces
You don't wanna see these guys without their masks on
You don't wanna see these guys without their masks on


I went down to the gas station for no particular reason
Heard the screams from the high school, it's football season
Empty lot the station faces will probably be there forever
I climbed over the four foot fence; I was trying to sever the tether
Moon in the sky, cold as a stone
Spend each night in your arms, always wake up alone

I lay down in the weeds, it was a real cold night
I was happy 'til the overnight attendant
Switched on the floodlight
Walking home I was talking to you under my breath
Saying things I would never say directly
I heard a siren on the highway up ahead
Kinda wish they'd come and get me
Frost on the sidewalk, white as a bone
Tried to get close to you again, always wake up alone
And as I was crossing our doorstep
I hesitated just a moment there
Remembered the day we moved into our small house
'til the vision got too vivid to bear

You were almost asleep, halfway undressed
I lay right down next to you
Held your head against my chest
And a guy with any kind of courage
Would maybe stop to think the matter through
Maybe hold you still and raise the question
Instead of blindly holding on to you
But we crank up the heat
And you giggle and moan
Spend all night in the company of ghosts, always wake up alone


Wipe down the windshields and roll down the windows
Let's go where the jackals are breeding
Wrap this bandana around your head
Don't let anyone see that you're bleeding
Fire up the scanner and keep your eyes on it
Don't speak unless someone speaks to you
Hands in your pockets and sun on your face
The warm love of God coursing through you

Home again
Home again
Garden Grove
Garden Grove
I can remember when we were in high school
Our dreams were like fugitive warlords
Plotting triumphant returns to the city
Keeping TEC-9s tucked under the floorboards, ah
Now we are practical men of the world
We tether our dreams to the turf
And cruise down these alleys for honey to feed them
Jellyfish riding the surf
Shoving our heads straight into the guts of the stove

Home again
Garden Grove
Garden Grove


Hair plastered to her cheeks
Marduk t-shirt sticking to her skin
Refugee from a disco in old east Berlin

Weightless formless blameless nameless
Stray syllables were gurgling
From her throat one at a time
Face hidden from my view
I let myself imagine she was you
Only weightless, formless, blameless, nameless
And when I washed my hands
I ran the water hotter than I could stand
Half rising to a crouch
Sinking back down to the floor
In your walking keep your head low
Try to leave no traces when you go

Stay weightless, formless, blameless, nameless


Out in the street
Free and young
Songs of the Great God
Wild on my tongue
Here come thenewguys again
Humorless men
Lethe who's without sin
Throw the firstone, like you said
Let anyone else throw the second
As long as it connects with your head
One summer, then all of this is gone
One more summer, then no more swan

Hand me a torch why not
Let's get some kicks in while the flame's still hot
They'll do what they were gonna do anyway
But Carthage may rise again one day
"With the measure that you used, so shall it be measured to you,"
So you say, and it's true

One summer, then all of this is gone
One more summer, then no more swan


The cool breeze that blows is somebody's fault
The summer heat tries to burn through
And I look over to warn you but something's happening
The morning glories climb the wall
And you speak in a slow drawl
I'm trying to piece together what you're saying
But the birds are screeching, the hounds are baying
I don't remember there being any hounds around here
We lean back and we clink our glasses
Raise the drinks to our thirsty mouths
And thick as molasses ice cold vodka eases in as
The low pressure system brings the breezes in
And they sashay and pirouette above you
The only thing I know is that I love you
And I'm holding on
Yeah


Across the Burnside Bridge
Before anyone shot their movies there
We hid from the whipping rain
When we had run out of cocaine
Dispatch down to Plaid Pantry
Two on point and two on sentry
Ah, the joys that the lesser days bring
Make you throw back your heads and sing

God bless all petty thieves
With tins of oysters up their sleeves
Feast when you can
And dream when there's nothing to feast on
Across a different bridge today
Over the river and down Broadway
Feels so good to have you here
Some of you will be dead next year
I see your destinies above you
Like angels who don't love you
Let them kiss you and hold you tight
As long as the money's right

God bless all my old friends
And god bless me too, why pretend?
Feast when you can
And dream when there's nothing to feast on

God bless the guys from my old neighborhood
Gone past the point where any blessings can do them any good

Attach the C-4 where you must
Disappear in a cloud of dust
But spare a thought for what it covers up
Pour a triple and raise your cup
We were here once, me and my friends
But we destroyed all of the evidence
And vanished into the night
At least we got that one right
You might also like
God bless us, all of us
We who learn to shun the light
God bless all vampires every night
Feast when you can
Feast when you can
Feast when you can
Feast when you can


The trees were all decked out in their best fall colors
There was a snap in the air
When you eased down the window
And the New York sun brought out the highlights in your hair
And gently, gently, the constellations aligned
And as we crossed over the Throgs Neck Bridge
I had something on my mind

When we rolled down the street
In the cool of the morning
I could feel the new day dawn
And somebody'd gone and turned the waterworks on
And slowly, surely, I saw the whole story unwind
I had never loved anyone like I loved you
And I had something on my mind


This tiny sector can't contain me
Suit up in a flash
Slipping symbolsbravely,bravely
Go where I'mnot wanted
Stand where the light hitshard
Almost full grown
Drive home alone and listen to the slow parts
In a new universe
Trying to find the mask that fits me
Shaking the curse
Behaving as the beacons bid me
Denim and leather
Silver strap to please the diehards
Let me dance 'til I die
Turn the volume up high and listen to the slow parts
Alin ships from ancient realms (Ships from ancient ralms)
Ageless captains at their helms (Captains at their helms)
Rage from the sea
Let it begin with me
Half-life of my toxins
Difficult to calculate
Stock up on gauze in case of accidents
Try to keep my story straight
Dozens like me
Never quite free, filling out our dance cards
Mark my time on the wall
Answer the call and listen to the slow parts


Mind your business and you won't get hurt
Be true to the things you said you'd be true to
Always keep your objective in view
Keep two working contacts among your effects
See the tall poppies with their tender fragile necks
Solomon in all his glory not arrayed like these
Bending in the wind like pilgrims on their knees
Those who came to learn these lessons
Left no trace of their presnce
Always have a flashlight, just in case
Show th world your true face
Burn such fuel as you need to burn
Learn to wait your turn
Count the heads in the bunks before you turn in for the night
Lace your boots up tight
Secure the rope to the pole
Keep a sense of wonder when you finally reach your goal
Those who came to learn these lessons
Left no trace of their presence
Leave nothing behind
Keep a positive thought in your mind
If you can't find anything nice to say
Drift away
Retain a sense of grace when it's time to cut the cord
Crack through the crust, fall to your knees, and praise the Lord
Listen for the voices calling out from down below
Steady as you go
What will they say back home about you
Who always kept your objective in view
Whose effects included contacts that finally got found
Inside the Arctic Circle, scattered on the ground
You might also likeThose who came to learn these lessons
Left no trace of their presence


I'm going to raise a nice cold glass of water
And toast the living and the dead
Who've gone before me and my head
Will throb like an old wound reopening
When I get off the bus down there my children
They all are going to greet me at the station
Like gypsies they will dance around me and
The choral droning sounds their voices make will
Saturate the evening
When I get off the wheel I'm going to stop
And make amends to everyone I've wounded
And when I wave my magic wand
Those few who've slipped the surly bonds
Will rise like salmon at the spawning


This is just to say hello
And to let you know I think of you from time to time
I know I never really knew you, but somehow I miss you
And wish that you'd stayed in my life

Making contact gets harder
As the silence grows longer
And isn't it only me
Who'd like us to see each other?
How I would hate to be a bother
The way we left it was you'd ring
I'm under no illusion
As to what I meant to you
But you made an impression
And sometimes I still feel the bruise
Sometimes I still feel the bruise

Now and then I stumble on
What I've misplaced but never lost
An ache I first felt long ago
Though you've appeared and disappeared
Throughout these past few years
I'd be surprised if you now showed

Making contact gets harder
As the silence grows longer
And why would you think of me
When you were not the one in love
When you were not the dreamer
When you were just the dream?

I'm under no illusion
As to what I meant to you
But you made an impression
And sometimes I still feel the bruise
Sometimes I still feel the bruise


I came to see you up there in intensive care
They had handcuffed you to your bed
There were tubes going into you and out from you
Bright white gauze bandages at your head

I am a mole
Sticking his head above the surface of the earth
I am a mole
Sticking his head above the surface of the earth
And then they said, "Lights out", and it was lights out
And they gave you your medication
I know what you want, and you know what I want
Information, information

I am a mole
Sticking his head above the surface of the earth
I am a mole
Sticking his head above the surface of the earth

Out in the desert we'll have no worries
Out in the desert just you and me
I came to see you up there in intensive care
Out in the desert we'll live carefree

I am a mole
Sticking his head above the surface of the earth
I am a mole
Sticking his head above the surface of the earth


You turned to me and asked me if I'd always be your boy
As we drove across the river into western Illinois
And on the railroad bridge, half a mile of solid steel
Wheels were spitting out sparks, scraping at the rails

Wind in your hair, alright
Sunset spilling through the rear window
Your white t-shirt hugging your shoulders
Beaded with sweat
On the day that I become so forgetful
That all of this melts away
I will burn all the calendars that counted the years down
To such a worthless day
As we walked across the parking lot towards the motel office
We were walking with a benediction on us
Light was everywhere, the building stood against the sky
Like a monument to desperation, two floors high

A mile and a half from the river
We went back to the car to get our overnight bags
Sunset spilling through your earrings
All over your body
When we shut the motel room door behind us
We knew we'd hit the motherlode
On the day that I forget you
I hope my heart explodes


I take my coffee light and sweet
Show up for dinner when you tell me to
And I heap the sugar high and white on everything I eat
Carry an apple in my pocket
I write reminders on my skin
Clip meaningless pictures from old magazines
I tape them to the walls, it's a bad place I'm in
And nothing you can say or do will stop me
And a thousand dead friends can't stop me
I go back to places I remember
See what's been going on without me
Stare down the strangers at the bus stop
Pretend they've been gossiping about me
White sugar by the spoonful
Cantaloupes and grapes and watermelons
I force it down like it was medicine
Anybody asks, you tell 'em what you want to tell 'em
But the best you've got is powerless against me
And all your little schemes break when they come crashing up against me
Ah


Hey, I'm totally in the full heat of this one, so I haven't bothered totune,so I'm notat 440 here. I don't knowwhat to tell you. I'm in G, anyway, if anybody's taking notes. "January 31, 438."

When the hunger turns in on itself, it begins to devour its host
Who do you turn to for help?
Who do you love the most?

I dance with the ones that brought me
I dance with the ones that brought me here
When the word comes down
The wire that they're looking to make an example of you
Skin and bones around a campfire beneath the stars
No good end in view

I dance with the ones that brought me
I dance with the ones that brought me here

I dance in the dark, all alone
I dance for the god on the throne
If they come catch me and arrest me, mid step
Let me go down dancing, let me be the last one left

Crushed like a sea shell by a sea-side warrior's foot
Trying to turn the tide
When the hunger's all that holds you together
Who do you want by your side?

I dance with the ones that brought me, yeah
I dance with the ones that brought me here


Fill the cast-iron kettle with water and magnolia blossom
Let it boil, let the water roll
Let the fire take its toll
I'm coming home
Dust off the idols, give them something to eat
I think they're hungry
I know I'm starving half to death
I know you're waiting
I know you've been waiting for a long, long time
And I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Set the table, those three extra places:
One for me, one for your doubts, and one for God
Let the incense burn
In every room
Feel the fullness of time
In the empty tomb
Feel the future kicking in your womb
I'm coming home
I'm coming home


I dug a hole and filled it up with compost
Rested on the cool grass for a minute
I saw the future in a dream last night
There’s nothing in it
I set the sapling in the hole
Started gently tamping down the dirt
I saw the future in a dream last night
Somebody’s gonna get hurt, somebody’s gonna get hurt
I hope it’s not me
But I suspect it’s going to have to be
I dug my heels in for the winter
And I waited for the snow
But something was stuck up in the clouds
Something was stuck up there
It couldn’t let go
And when its time came I could see it happen
Blossoms black and sweet as Texas crude
I saw the future flowering like a ruptured vessel
Somebody’s gonna get screwed
It won’t be me
Someday I am going to walk out of here free


Why should we hide from anyone?
Held you in my arms for the first time that day
Felt like God's anointed when you didn't push me away

Gold light shining on so many things
In the age of kings
Gold light shining on so many things
In the age of kings
Lean on the concrete walls in shadow
Why should we wait to throw the switch?
Felt your name burning, like a tattoo into my skin
Rain on the clay tiles all night, your head nestled beneath my chin

Gold light shining on so many things
In the age of kings
Gold light shining on so many things
In the age of kings
In the lost age
Where the jewels hide
And the sword sticks
In the waiting stone
Still warm
Small chambers shrinking till they vanish
Wolves in the hallway gaining ground
Reached down to the moment when I should have said something true
Shadows and their sources now stealing away with you

Gold light shining on so many things
In the age of kings
Gold light shining on so many things
In the age of kings


Down at the end of a bombed-out street
The shell of a house where my friendsandme used tomeet
Someday the old flesh will giveway to the new
Find a functioning mirror inside and slip right through

And there, there I will be
And who, who's coming with me?
To show me my one true face
When I arrive at my preordained place
Chain of command maybe 10 years long
I emerge in Manhattan, still young and strong
Someday the hellhound will pick up the scent on the trail
Zero in on my penthouse and then pierce the veil

And there, there I will be
And who, who's coming with me?
To show me my one true face
When I arrive at my preordained place

Hopeless but free
Lit up like a marquee shining over the freeway
Where will my long trail end?
Here, here with my new friend

Fruits of the spirit heavy on the vine
Undying hunger deep in the bloodline
Dodge the hook like a steel head
Swim right through the night
Break the surface and rise like a geyser
When my time is right
You might also like
And there, there I'll be
And who, who among you, who's coming with me?
To show me my one true face
When I arrive at my preordained place

When I arrive, yeah
When I arrive

It was raining outside, so I cleaned house today
Spent half of the morning throwing old things away
Try not to get caught up, try to think like a machine
Focus in on the task, try not to think about what it means

Can't get you out of my head
Lost without you, half dead

Took my spot at the window, looked out at the road
Dots and dashes of traffic, like a message in code
And whole boxes of memories wrapped up at the curb
I sang songs to myself, didn't have any words
Can't get you out of my head
Lost without you, half dead

Stole out to the backyard late last night
Pine trees frozen in the silvery moonlight
Rising like giants from the cold earth
What are the years we gave each other ever gonna be worth?

Can't get you out of my head
Lost without you, half dead


They came like beasts who'd tasted blood
First a few and then the flood
Coursing over hillanddale
Wet paw printson their bloody trail
Return the peaceyou took from me
Give me back my community
Show us thegoodwillyouwere shown
But leaveus alone

And restorethe temple of Isis at Memphis
Yeah, restore the temple of Isis at Memphis
Their hunger like a worm inside them
No sacred place could be denied them
They who talk all day of beauty
Call all the plain things dirty
Melted holes in celluloid
Give me back what you've destroyed
You who come demanding proof
Let your God rebuild this roof

And restore the temple of Isis at Memphis
Yeah, restore the temple of Isis at Memphis

Make it whole again if you can
Stand in the smoke and say some prayers
Wave your hand

And restore the temple of Isis at Memphis
Restore the temple of Isis at Memphis


We broke the doorknob off the door
The door swung open easily
We sauntered into the poorly-lit store
And looked around lazily
We stole every bit of candy they had inside
Gobbled it all up greedily on our three month ride

I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
You headed out to the getaway car
And hit the open road
I saw something written in tall, clear letters on your face
But I could not break the code
We had hot caramel sticking to our teeth
And the only love I've ever known burning underneath

I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone

I'm gonna miss you when you're gone
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone


From the CVS
Use too much
And make a great big mess
Wait where shadows
Mask or hide my scent
So many so-called friends
Working for the government

Dig through the trash
Sleep on the grates
And watch for the cars
With the counterfeit Florida plates
Scribble ciphers
On the library bathroom wall
Map a path from here to home
Can't quite catch 'em all
Calculate magnetic north
And turn the other way
Wait for the coming disaster
I could do this all day

Dig through the trash
Sleep on the grates
And watch for the cars
With the counterfeit Florida plates

It seems like everyone's cut me free
And left me to the tender cares
Of my faceless enemy
Feel so hungry
I'll probably pass out soon
Look for a tree to lean up against
Whistle a tuneless tune
You might also likeThis may be the night
My point men finally come
Wait for the fog to catch up with me
So I can at least feel numb
Dig through the trash
Sleep on the grates
And watch for the cars
With the counterfeit Florida plates

With the counterfeit Florida plates


The sun came up above the strange, white plain
Blood red flowers all white with rain
And the spirit wasn't really willing anymore
But the flesh was very, very strong
I've got very little money left
And I got no sense
But I'll have none of your goddamned impudence
The sun came up above the new, white fields
Everything was new again
Pure power stripped of meaning
Sky burning, spring cleaning

Daisies on the hillside like cancer on the skin
Pretty, little, yellow eyes that flutter in the wind
I'd be grateful my children aren't here to see this
If you'd ever seen fit to give me children
And my defenses may be working with a skeleton crew
But I'll be skinned alive before I'll take this from you
The sun came up above the ocean out west
All the colors of the rainbow

Stand up straight, you can see the house leaning
Day breaking, spring cleaning


Just imagine a time and place
Sentient objects adrift in space
Trying to do the needful math
Trying to find the secret path

Seas gone silent in the spiral shell
When you fell

Blazing torches to light the way
All fuel burned right up in just one day
Will there be another way?
That won't be for you to say
You who took with you the ancient spell
When you fell

Hurt too hard too long and die too young
Silver dollar glistening on your tongue

May your passage be assured
There may your foul afflictions all be cured
Systems closing down on several fronts
You will always have been here once

Cap the west's final wildcat well
When you fell


Toward the tail-end of the age that's almost finished
Where the highway starts to crack andnobodyfixes it
I waswandering through an undeveloped tract
Out nearthe ocean
100 acres, we will build to suit
See what there is to see before it's gone
Somebody's always just about to put some kind of
Awful plan in motion
Eastern red cedars, and the pines
And suddenly an elevated stone slab
In what must have been a clearing once
Try to recognize the signals and the signposts
My curiosity
Will likely always get the best of me

It's like that one thing
My dad kept trying to tell me
As the twilight
Inched its way on up his body

Get out
Get out
Get out
Get out

Well, of course I climbed atop the slab and I lay down on it
I am a child
I had my face toward the sky lying there in the sun
With both my eyes closed
You might also likeWoke up in near darkness
What the hell is wrong with me
Volunteer pines in the hundreds in the dusk
Like military tentpoles

Let my eyes adjust
Try to read the markings on the slab
Weird alphabets I felt sure I hadn't seen
Just before I passed out
Stars growing brighter
Me looking up
Like a lobster in a cage down in the depths
Beneath the bottom of a glass boat

And I heard a voice
From somewhere out beyond the free fall
Like a captive soldier
Just trying to warn his brothers

Get out
Get out
Get out
Get out


When the villagers come to my door
I will hide underneath the table in the dining room
Knees drawn to my chest
When the villagers come to my door
I will breathe shallow breaths from high up in my stomach
Ah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah

Waiting for the front door to splinter
Waiting all winter
When the villagers come to my door
I'll be all tucked away with my face to the floor and my eyes closed
And no one knows how to keep secrets 'round here
They tell everyone everything, soon as they know
And then where is there left for poor sinners to go?

Waiting for the front door to splinter
Waiting all winter


Come hard through the fog
Blindfolded and bound
Till we stand at the edge
Of a hole in the ground
We hold hands, and we jump
And as we fall, we sing
Paupers hammering the walls of the castle
Going to meet the king
Never sleep, remember to breathe deep
Never sleep, remember to breathe
Breathe deep

Crash in from deep space
Shot birds falling fast
Who will be there to catch us in his jaw
When we arrive, alive, at last?
I can't hear you in the dark
Wish I knew where you'd gone
Know you're there, off in the shadows somewhere
Try to soldier on

Never sleep, remember to breathe deep
Never sleep, remember to breathe
Breathe deep

And breathe humbly
Secure your mouthpiece when you can

Toxic shapes adorn the walls
As we rise from our knees
Someone's coming to reward us, you wait and see
Or crush us both like fleas
You might also like
Never sleep, remember to breathe deep
Never sleep, remember to breathe
Breathe deep

As foretold by the ancient texts

New dreams
New dreams for the ratqueen
Newdreams
Newdreams for therat queen
Great warmthrobbing hum of the undercity
At one with the purpose
I am a faceless, nameless acolyte
Here tonight at your service
Take my visions, make them real
Impose them on the world above
All the dead sleepwalkers
Who never learned how to love

New dreams
New dreams for the rat queen
New dreams
New dreams for the rat queen

Brand new dreams
Great visions
Something heady and threatening
On the boil in the kitchen
Arise from the storm drains
Take to the streets

The stench of defeat

Of the fast food dumpster
Look how they jump when we show up

We sail, we sleep, we scry dry land
We dig a pit beneath the sand
A placetokeep the sunat bay
At dark we rise andfind our way

With our faithful companion by our side
Put it all on the table and let it ride
Close to the dropoff on our long slide
The land we left becomes a dream
The ghosts we knew, they rise like steam
They leave some trails against the sky
All but invisible to the eye

With our faithful companion by our side
Put it all on the table and let it ride
Close to the dropoff on our long slide

Call off the search party
Let mourners wail by the shore
Point to the spot where our ship disappeared
We're not coming home anymore

Should you succeed and breach the coast
You tell your friends you've seen a ghost
You tell them all there's nothing here worth dying for
You leave it there with your

Faithful companion by our side
Put it all on the table and let it ride
We are close to the dropoff on our long slide
Go


If you really want to conjure up a ghost
Cultivate a space for the things that hurt you most
Rake the sands until they surface
Blind their tiny eyes

Stake out your position, let your armor fall
Stay put till they find you, it won't take long at all
Rake the sands until they surface
Up they come, gone translucent
They're coming up, no matter what
Fools rush in, and the doors slam shut

Ghosts of my childhood, stay with me if you will
Find a place where there's water, hold you under till you're still
Rake the sands until they surface
Don't let anybody call them ugly


We were parked in your car
In our neutral meeting place, the Episcopalian churchyard
I had things I’d been meaning to say
But in the dazzling winter sun that late I could feel them melt away
And through the warm radio static
I couldn’t hear my stage directions
And the fog on the windshield
Obscured our sad reflections
I felt so desperate in your arms
I felt so desperate in your arms

We were parked near some trees
And the moonlight soaked the branches in ever-deepening degrees
Had my hand in your hair
Trying to keep my cool ‘til it became too much to bear
When we cracked the windows open
Well the air was just so sweet
We could hear the cars ten feet away
Out there on the street

I felt so desperate in your arms
I felt so desperate in your arms


Echoes from a nursery rhyme
Hide in plain sight all this time
Here you come splashing inyoursummer clothes
You andyour pale pink toes
Just there wherethe shadow falls
There we follow one and all
Can't resist the creeping dark
Ready to make our mark
Little red fish beneath the surface of the water
Testing the break point in case we get lucky

Ancient blood is patient blood
We were here before the flood
Waiting for our time to shine
Sparks in a silver mine
Shorebirds deal death all day long
We are weak but they are strong
Lose some friends along the way
Then in you come one day

Little red fish beneath the surface of the water
Scales in the sun, stars in a shot glass
Testing the break point in case we get lucky

Take your time, we've got all day
Days beyond that, come what may
If you get home tell all your friends
The spawning tide never ends
You might also likeSay what you felt when you found us here
Here where the waters run crystal clear
One summer day in your summer clothes
The day you saw several ghosts

Little red fish beneath the surface of the water
Hungry for years, senses sharpened by the hunger
Testing the break point in case we get lucky
Testing the break point in case we get lucky


We don't get cable in Belle Plaine
But on Thursday night there's matches on TV
Get kicked out of the living room for watching
My brother and me, my brother and me
Keep watching with the lights out back in his room
Chris Jericho starts tearing up the set
I want to do right by my brother
I want to do right by this feeling in my gut
Everybody's got their own spot
Find mine
In 64 point type atop the top line
Up on the top line

Head off to camp in Boston
Come up through the independents
Those who would stand between me and my final destination get torched inside the fire of my transcendence
California, Minnesota, Massachusetts
They can tell I'm coming up by the expression on my face
I'm gonna make a lot of money
Everyone I love is going to have their own safe place

Everybody's got their own spot
Find mine
In 64 point type atop the top line
Up on the top line


Shadows on the broad lawn, canopy of trees
Sometime after midnight, the ground is gonna freeze
Birds in the frosty air, what are they doing there?

Greenhouse full of butcher's broom, breezes at my back
Some time before the sun comes up, the earth is gonna crack
I look down at my hands like they were mirrors

Fresh coffee at sunrise, warm my lips against the cup
Been waiting such a long time now, my number's finally coming up
All the neighbors come on out to their front porches, waving torches


Seeds came in the mail today from Holland
And the language on the package is wonderful and strange
All sorts of flowers that grow up from the earth
In goodly colors gloriously arranged
I circled the house and I scattered them around
Let the water sink down into the soil
Stared a long time at the residue
Blood, milk and oil
God the humidity is something
Our shirts are soaked clean through
The house is throbbing and the heat keeps coming
And I keep looking at you

And then you're singing in Dutch to me
And I recognize the song
It seems so old and so fragile
And I haven't heard it in so long
We may throw the windows open later
But we are not as far west as you suppose we are
Hot wind coming off the water
Sky gone crazy with stars
While we stay here we imagine we're alive
We see shadows on the walls
There's something waiting for us in the hot, wet air
Sweat, water and alcohol
Just the old blood
Rising up through the wooden floor again
Just the old love
Asking for more again



Catch a lucky break, try to make it last
Rig a blanket curtain up between the present and the past
Play my lucky numbers for most of what they're worth
Lie about my age right down to my last day on this earth

Set your sights on good fortune, concentrate
Pull back the hammer, try to hold the gun straight

Hit the gym each night, stay cool and seldom speak
Keep the heart of a champion—never let them see you're weak
And whatever they say on your page three mention
Focus on the parts that make you feel good, be grateful for the attention
Set your sights on good fortune, concentrate
Pull back the hammer, try to hold the gun straight

Try to hold the gun straight, and true, and steady
Let the frame find you when the cameraman's ready
Work until I drop, drift from place to place
Ehrenfield, Pennsylvania scratched into my face

Set your sights on good fortune, concentrate
Pull back the hammer, try to hold the gun straight
Try to hold the gun straight


They asked me where I'd been of late
I hadn't been anywhere but what was I going to say?
Two hopeful people looking at me that way
You and your brother
You both escaped the curse
You can't comprehend what it's like
We stood in the sunlight and they asked me where I'd been
Held the gate open, told me to come on in
I saw the damp green grass so nice on the other side
Couldn't explain myself to them but I tried
You and your brother
You both escaped the curse
So you can't comprehend what it's like
Ground was dry but giving, the sky was nearly black
Saw some old friends when I looked back
Remember my old home, haven't forgotten yet
What happens on the day when I forget
You and your brother
You both escaped the curse
So you can't comprehend what it's like


Bluejays and cardinals all come out to play;
The highway traffic gets out of your way
Skies clear up if they're overcast
Pitbulls are gentle when you come past
The stars come out of hiding for you
And I would too

But this world couldn't hold you
You slipped free
Yeah, this world couldn't hold you
You slipped free without me
New sheen all over everything
When you open up your mouth to sing
Baseballs travel farther when you watch them fly
Apples fatten on the tree when you walk by
You bring something unreplaceable to each and every day
Or you used to, anyway

But this world couldn't hold you
You slipped free
Yeah, this world couldn't hold you
You slipped free without me


Signal drawn upon the bricks of a clinic for the dispossessed
Collect the brine from the rain gutters, let the devil take the rest
Rats returning home to our nest

Beneath the streets of the city with my brethren
In the neverending shadows
Beneath the streets of the city with my brethren
In the neverending shadows, there I go
Secret hymnal with the words in a version of the mother tongue
Walls envelop all of us like a mother who protects her young
Spores at play deep down in our lungs

Beneath the streets of the city with my brethren
In the neverending shadow
Beneath the streets of the city with my brethren
In the neverending shadow, there I go


The cave mouth shines
By pure force of will
I look down on the world
From the top of this lonesome hill
And you can run, and run some more
From here all the way to Singapore

But I will carry you home in my teeth
In the great hall you drink red wine
You chew meat off the bone
I beat down the new path to the castle
I come naked and alone
I laid my son on the bier; I burned the wreath
Fire overhead, water underneath
You can stand up, or you can run
You and I both know what you've done

And I will carry you home
I will carry you home
I will carry you home in my teeth


If you get there before me, will you save me a seat?
If you get there before me, would you save me a seat?
And if I never get there at all
Would you leave the seat empty?

If you get there before me, will you light us a fire?
If you get there before me, will you light us a fire?
And if I never show, will you watch the embers glow?
Would you keep the fire burning?
This is a song for you
In case I never make it through to where you are
This is a song for you
In case I never make it through to where you are


And... the new song, which has no title as of yet
1,2,3,4

In comes you, not the same person I knew
Looking roughly the same, but something hungry getting restless in your brain
So there I go, not the same person that you used to know
Peeking through the fisheye lens at you

And the cornet blows where the oleander grows
And us two, not the same people that our old friends knew
And so down the street, you head in the high summer heat
White long-sleeved Oxford pushed up to just before your elbows
Black pumps and a medium length black skirt
Eating a path through the dark damp earth
I hope they've got plenty of money where you're going

And the cornet blows where the oleander grows
And us two, not the same people that our old friends knew


Figure this out too late
It's not thedestinationthat makes thedifference
It's the freight
Everything becomes a blurfrom six feet away
Get used to this
Every card ever turnedoverremainsin place
Get usedto this
Not everywave is a tidal wave
Not every wave is a tidal wave
It's not the mutiny that gets written down in the diary
It's the manifest
Forgotten cargo in obsolete measurements
Anybody's guess
Even the proud, even the very proud
Probably die on their knees
Twin masts out on the open seas
Mistaken for trees
Not every wave is a tidal wave
Not every wave is a tidal wave


When I hear the screeching weather vane
In the wild wind and the hissing rain
I know that one of us, I'm not saying who
Has got rocks in her head
As the rain comes through the open window
But you don't think so

I sure do love you
I sure do love you
When I notice that the radio is broken
I see you standing there in the doorway, soaking
The water drizzles off of you down to the floor
And I say that I don't want to live in New England anymore
Some flower petals stick to your skin
I grab hold of your hip, and I pull you in

When the building establishes control
When the thunder from the north begins to roll down our way
I know I've been right all along
And you start singing that stupid children's song
You think I don't know it
But I just don't feel like singing it

I sure do love you
I sure do love you


There were signs up in the sky
When we gathered by the garden wall
Everybody on his best behavior
Listening for the altar call

High priest of Salem in his robes
Ranting at the coming of the day
Ravens at the gates
Frightening all the visitors away
I laid down by the water
Dreamed a dream of where I come from
Old things made new
Waiting for you

There were wooden wind chimes rustling
In the trees above the anthills on the dunes
On the high winds we could hear them
Old familiar tunes

The little bit of faith we had once
Like the memory of a movie
They got burned up in the great fire
Reassembling itself slowly but surely

I laid down by the water
Dreamed a dream of where I come from
Old things made new
Waiting for you


Hi, it's the Mountain Goats
It's the seventeenth of December
At 9:34 in the morning
And this is called "No, I Can't"

You bought me some candy
And you bought me some flowers
And you bought me a sofa
And you bought me a radio
Thank you for the candy
Thank you for the flowers
Thank you for the sofa

Thanks for the filing cabinet
I don't know what I did without it

Now I have everything I need
Now I have everything I need

You came by, and you came in
And you let the wind in
It must be cold outside
We looked out through the sliding glass door
But I'd forgotten what we were looking for
Thank you for coming by
It's nice to see you once in a while
Thank you for the coat I forgot to mention
I've been freezing in here
I've been freezing in here

Hey, Mr. Hughes and Mr. Vanderslice, uh, this is a new song
I'm really excited ab--, about, and uh and so since I wrote it on my old cort guitar instead of the new one I, I want to play on that just for purposes of 'cause I've been writing it and so forth so that's why it sounds a little beat up and flat and everything, 'cause these strings are old and everything, so sorry about that. Uh, it's i--it's in A. I think I'm tuned to an A. It should be called Hawaiian Feeling, but it probably can't be called that. Um, okay, right. Alright

I will wake up at six a.m. again
And I will find my way to the front door
Like a soldier crawling through the smoking carnage
Smoldering bodies at my feet
I'd love to stick around, but I've got someone to meet
And I will put my best foot forward
And I'll thank god I made it out of there
On the day when my new friends come
I will present myself in my nice white tuxedo jacket
And I will look out at the day through my dark sunglasses
And take in the scene
The house behind me and the people in it
Will all go up like steam in just a minute
There's gonna be a redefining of some borders
And I will receive my orders
On the day when my new friends come

The rooftops and the sidewalks
Will all melt like plastic
And oh friends, old friends, dear friends
I'm gonna look fantastic

There won't be any reason left to cry
'cause there won't be any people left to cry for
My memory's gonna vaporize itself
And my Italian shoes, well, they will be to die for
I believe I can fly
Might you look up at me and wave goodbye
On the day when my new friends come?


All your brambles, all your creeping vines
All of the trash that people leave behind
All yourfine,fine columns pokingup through the pond scum

We willhave uses for these things when we come

Cracks in the marble you hauled in from the quarry
These will be seen by all in all their glory
Long hidden shadows of the places they came from
We will bring memories of these things when we come

All your abandoned things
Once fine vestments, statues with wings
They have their uses, every one
Let me slither across them in the sun

Pale imitations that you brought back from afar
We will show them to you as they are
Wind through the ruins, high and lonesome

We will have uses for these things when we come


Take the trouble to pronounce the street names right
People like it when you show respect
Look out the window at the softening asphalt
The dreamy shimmer of the haze effect

Wear my lizard suit to the party
It's so hard to get noticed in this town

Almost invisible aboard the train
So many people who you just can't read
Dawdle when I reach the final station
Don't make a move until the crowds recede
Wear my lizard suit to th party
It's so hard to get noticed in this town

Wait for my cue
Sarch for one clue
I have to trust that my compass stays true

Let my phobias control my habits
Let my habits form the shapes of days
All alone up on the rooftop sometimes
Among the beacons where the lightning plays

I wear my lizard suit to the party
It's so hard to get noticed in this town


You smile at me in total defiance of all decency
You've got it down to a science, that innocent look
You've got it practiced real good
But I know you'd kill me if you could stand the sight of blood

If I'd been a fly on the wall a little earlier
If I'd been one of the innumerable flies in this room
If I'd been a fly on the wall a little earlier
It would've been real different around here
You try to speak but the buzzing's too loud
And it's hard to make you laugh through the dense black cloud
That surrounds us both, and it's just as well
You call them up, let the whole house go to hell

If I'd been one of these flies
I would've lodged myself firmly underneath your eyelid
If I'd been one of these flies a little earlier
It would've been real different around here


Bang the small rocks on the big ones
Till the small ones are sharp and clean
Catch something, kill something
New blade cuts real keen

And then the grass grows up to cover up the fire pit and the forge
Half a world away from the Olduvai Gorge

Chew these roots for a toothache
Chew these ones for atmosphere
Dream the pleasant dreams that people dream
When they grow up down here
And then the grass grows up to cover up the fire pit and the forge
Half a world away from the Olduvai Gorge

Take care of the old man
See if he's in pain
Have somebody stay with him
Comfort him when he complains

Keep to ourselves mostly
Few friends and fewer closer friends
Lead a long life if you're lucky
Hope it never ends

And then the grass grows up to cover up the fire pit and the forge
Half a world away from the Olduvai Gorge


When I catch sight of your face
And the late light falling on it
I feel scared and I scope the area out for a good place to hide
When I feel the way your fingers
Wiggle in my palm
I feel warm and I feel good inside

And I know that you're wearing a wire
But as the sun becomes a blazing orange ball of fire
I lose interest in this and other such inconsequential questions
When you kick off your shoes
And I see the wet grass give way underneath your feet
And the sunset soars up once more to its burial ground
Well, you look so sweet

And I know you'll be turning me in
But I also know your real name's not Amy Lynn
And as the orange globe rears up to swallow us, too
I see you look at me and figure out what I know about you
Well, I'm not telling
I'm not telling you anything


Mail-ordered body armor
Map to the Blue Bucket Mine
Guy who had a place down by the lakeside
Changing water to wine

Devastating schematics
Rough drafts of the 23rd Psalm
Paul Kersey never left his apartment
John Rambo never went to Vietnam
Armor-piercing Black Talons
From the first production run
Nobody's seen them in the wild
Since 1991

Out in the cul-de-sacs at midnight
Where the candy for the cannons comes from
I heard Buford Pusser was dirty
John Rambo never went to Vietnam

Shall we rise to the occasion
Or go to sleep for good in the trenches?
Dug in beneath a brilliant blue sky
Helmets hanging high in the branches

Empty vessels by the dozens
Diamonds in the sun
We worship nothing in the foxholes
John Rambo never went to Vietnam

John Rambo never went to Vietnam


When death came calling today
I heard the gentle grace of his cadences

I couldn't say no
I couldn't say no

When he showed me his new silk scarves
Laid out on a shiny black plastic tray
Couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say
Couldn't say, couldn't say no
I couldn't say no

And I'm sorry I couldn't
Do you know how badly I wanted to?
Didn't want, didn't want, didn't want
Didn't want, didn't want to lose you

But his smile was dazzling
And his eyes were sparkling
Like moonlight on the water at midnight

Couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say
Couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say no
I couldn't say no


Get tired of coming in from the mountains every year
Find some place to set upshoparound here
Spread outa little, circulate
A log that floatsdown river
Will surely take on weight

Meet some people, make somefriends
Howlongtill we getsent back tothe mountains?
It all depends
On the hopeful
And the cunning
And the faithful
The well-positioned
Filthy but graceful

Get familiar with affairs of state
Foretell the future
Get a pretty good success rate
Notch some wins, take some losses
Be nice to the guys who wear necklaces with crosses
They will stab you in the back

You gotta turn the other cheek
You gotta learn to love Jesus, so to speak

Like the hopeful
And the cunning
And the faithful
The well-positioned
Filthy but graceful
You might also like
Real filthy, think about getting clean
Even hear the soldiers talk about it, down at the canteen
Little kings keep coming, one another's head
Which is exactly how the portents read
Watch with wonder
Fail to discern
These people never learn
How long till the snake devours its tail?
Longer than we think

Still it's gotta happen sometime
Until then, raise a drink

To the hopeful
And the cunning
And the faithful
The well-positioned
Filthy but graceful


Working bitter calculations with a slide rule
The grim particulars of poisoning the swimming pool
The way you looked me in the eye, ready to die
We were becoming what we are
Collapsing stars
When we chewed up children's aspirin like bubblegum
Till our hearts were beating deep and rich as kettle drums
We knew if we waited long enough the change would come
And then the day did come, and at last
Hold tight
Hold fast
Catch lightning in a jar
Collapsing stars
Told you to load up on provisions
We wouldn't be back for a while
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
Turn toward the camera and smile, smile, smile
When we ditched the plan to poison all our enemies
Tucked our weapons in a clearing, and covered them with leaves
We are gonna come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves one day
Well we are on our way
You can look
But you won't find
Another love like ours
Collapsing stars


I know what my weaknesses are
Probably better than you do
Revolutionary Chinese propaganda
The color of blue

I thought I knew what my weaknesses were anyway
And then the orange tree blossomed last Saturday
And there was nothing in it but pain for me
I know what can hurt me real bad
And what can't hurt me anymore
I know how to rise up with the sun
And I am learning what sleep's good for

I thought I'd figured out the world in its circular way
Then I saw the sun fall out of the sky the other day
There was nothing in it but pain for me

Squirrels climbing trees in bloom
Soft yellow light spilling into the room
My favorite records
My favorite books
The people I loved
The people I almost loved

Light beckoning, wind whistling
Hey hey, hey hey
Daybreak, river rolling
Hey, hey
La la la la


Every time they knock me down
I rise to my feet
Every time I take a bullet
They find a medic to patch me up real neat
You only have to run the numbers to know
Sooner or later everybody's gotta go
Bleed out, I'm gonna bleed out

I'm gonna bleed out, I'm gonna bleed out
There won't be anyone waiting to rush me to safety
I'm gonna let the long night take me
Bleed out, I'm gonna bleed out
Every bender needs a blackout
Every gauge deserves a top line
Every story needs a child
Who believes the brave hero's gonna be just fine
You just have to check the papers to see
Some of these children end up just like me
Bleed out, I'm gonna bleed out

I'm gonna bleed out, I'm gonna bleed out
I'm gonna make a gigantic mess
But it meant something important I guess
Bleed out, I'm gonna bleed out

Somewhere beyond imagination
Somewhere beneath the final delta
Washed up on the banks of a river at the height of the storm
Everybody's seeking shelter
Gonna dive right in
I can't swim
Bleed out, I'm gonna bleed out

I'm gonna bleed out, I'm gonna bleed out
There's gonna be a big spot where I once lay
And there won't even be a spot one day
Bleed out, I'm gonna bleed out
You might also like
There was a chance we'd make it through this
It's safe to say now that we've missed it
And I won't ever lose hope and I haven't lost hope
I'm just realistic
I will go down punching, but I will go down
And my corner men won't bring me back around
Bleed out, I'm gonna bleed out

The blood is pooling underneath me
Flowing freely from my mouth
You wanna call a med evac now
Knock yourself out
You can tell 'em when they get here you tried
But the smallest hole was several inches wide
Bleed out, I'm gonna bleed out

I'm gonna head into the darkness
I'm gonna head into the light
I will surrender to the slow lurching tide
Drift off into the night
There won't be any words of wisdom from me
Just a lake of blood for all the world to see
Bleed out, I'm gonna bleed out
I'm gonna bleed out, I'm gonna bleed out
I'm gonna tell my friends to all go to hell
And wish my enemies well
Bleed out, I'm gonna bleed out

I'm gonna bleed out, I'm gonna bleed out
If it's blood you want, I've got plenty of it
You're gonna love it
Bleed out, I'm gonna bleed out


Children by the water banks laughing long and loud
Changbai’s high fine western peaks just beneath the clouds
Currents in the water churning in their course
Body of a sea-lion, head just like a horse

Preacher in the soft brown sand begins to speak his piece
High winds in the treetops low flying winter geese
No one taking pictures everybody still
And then the water sought its course again the way that waters will
No one at the lakeside now, moon up in the sky
Night birds in the dragon spruce, moaning long and high
Backstroking on the surface, moonlight on its face
Floats the Tianchi Monster, staring into space

Out around the temple now narcissus in bloom
Censers packed with sandalwood send smoke into the room
Children in the sand outside on their hands and knees
Sketching pictures all day long of stranger things than these


Well, I met you at the blood bank
We were looking at the bags
Wondering if any of the colors
Matched any of the names we knew from the tags
You said "See look, that's yours
Stacked on top with your brother's
See how they resemble one another
Even in their plastic little covers?"

And I said I know it well
That secret that you know
But you don't know how to tell
It fucks with your honor
And it teases your head
But you know that it's good
Because it's running you with red
Then the snow started falling
We were stuck out in your car
You were rubbing both of my hands
Chewing on a candy bar
You said "Ain't this just like the present
To be showing up like this?"
As the moon waned to crescent
We started to kiss

And I said I know it well
That secret that we know
That we don't know how to tell
I'm in love with your honor
I'm in love with your cheeks
What's that noise up the stairs, babe?
Is that Christmas morning creaks?

And I know it well
I know it well
And I know it well
I know it well
And I know it well
I know it well
And I know it well
I know it well


Whooo!
John Darnielle coming to you live from the main room here at Overdub playing --Peter Hughes, Brandon Eggleston, and the blood capsules. One, two, three, and...

When the last of the East Coast money ran dry
And the casually-dressed bill collectors
Started casually dropping on by
And the residuals, but there weren't any more residuals
At least several months behind
On the payments to certain individuals
I strolled into the lobby
Mouth full
Blood capsules
I strolled into the lobby
Mouth full
Blood capsules

I'm off the juice for seven months
I learn to like living clean
But there just isn't any money
On the independent scene
Not even if you're cutting corners
Staying in nights, eating alone
Somebody's gotta pay the gas bill
It's not gonna go away on its own

I strolled into the lobby
Mouth full
Blood capsules
I strolled into the lobby
Mouth full
Blood capsules
You might also like
I'm the biggest guy in the bank line
Everybody else looks tiny
I could almost smell the fear
On the lunch-hour car salesman behind me
I know this isn't gonna work
I guess I'll see ya when I see ya
I can't work any other jobs
This was my last and best idea

I strolled into the lobby
Mouth full
Blood capsules
I strolled into the lobby
Mouth full
Blood capsules


The land's opening up like a blanket
And the dandelions spread themselves thickly out
Along the fields, which are, evidently, endless
And we are hotly in love with one another
We've got an unquenchable thirst in our throats
We are, for some reason, all the time bleeding
We are friendless

And we love these dogs that roll on the lawns here in Galesburg
Because they seem to know something nobody else knows
It is written in the smiles on their faces
And it rings in their high young voices
We are burning up all of our choices up here
Where the tall grass grows
Up here in Galesburg
The sky's opening up like an old wound
And the rain on our bodies is warm tonight
And the ground underneath us shakes in the cracking thunder
We can taste fresh blood in our mouths again
There is no chance of getting enough of it
And we tally up all our posessions, we're going under

Yeah, we love these dogs that loll in the rain here in Galesburg
As the new season rocks them in its terrible arms
They howl as if the world were ending
As we are watching the sky unwinding
Some of our promises were binding
Up here where our dreams take form
Up here in Galesburg
Up here in Galesburg


Maybe I never learned the value of a penny
Maybe I listened to that first Black Sabbath album
The one with the witch on the front, one time too many
But I think something's wrong with me
I think something's wrong with me
I think something's glued down wrong, permanently
Maybe it's the things I never learned how to do
Maybe it's the things I learned to do real well
Maybe it's the Irish whiskey that I like to drink
Maybe it's the California Zinfandel
But I think something's wrong with me
I think something's glued down wrong, maybe permanently
I'm gonna tell you once; you oughta listen
If you came here for comfort, you came to the wrong place
I've got a strong stomach and a murmur in my heart
I got a tremor in my hand, muscle twitches in my face
And I think something's wrong with me
I think something's snapped on wrong, maybe permanently
Yep


Into the source of the squall
I inevitably fall
Toward the well-spring of all agony
Shuffling endlessly
Whether or not it was always going to be this way
It only mattered yesterday

No skin like the skin you woke up in
No skin like the skin you woke up in
Up from the earth and the clay
Melting away
Never lose enough to find my form
Trudge through the storm
Wait in hope
For some as yet undiscovered isotope

No skin like the skin you woke up in
No skin like the skin you woke up in

When at last
The die gets cast
Read the numbers out loud
With your head bowed
Try to find a face to focus on
But the memory’s gone
Wherever my former self went
It was an accident
Try to picture him in my mind’s eye
Say goodbye

No skin like the skin you woke up in
No skin like the skin you woke up in


We came down to the shore
Always some desperate people there
Anywhere people congregate for pleasure
They'll gohuntingfor treasure
Come one,come all, fortune-seeking brothers
Pick up thefaint, faint scent
Of the faith of our fathers
Their names were known once to me
I hear them sometimes on the Song of the Sea
Take note of what will be gone
In the blink of an eye
The blue, blue water
The bone-white sky

You can set your watch by these guys
We will be high on the highway
Before they've even opened their eyes
Picture them scouring the sanctuary
Looking for gold
It never gets old

But there is no gold and there is no silver
And the South takes what the North delivers
Reverse the circuit sometimes
Every couple seasons
Remember our grandfathers
Whenever we need a reason

Take note of what will be gone
In the blink of an eye
The blue, blue water
The bone-white sky
Yeah


I'm going to live how I want
I'm going tobuildmyself a greatestate
With lots of statues out front
Choirsfrom the Curtis Institute
Singing me to sleep
Wake up and worshipthegreatgold sheep
I'm goingto walk thepathways of the ancients
I'm going to let my name be known
I'm going to see the wild haunts of this world
And carve a place out all my own
Heat up the iron until it glows
Burn the brand so deep
Wake up and worship the great gold sheep
There's only one, splendid and fine
The ages attest its wondrous design
You and me stand somehow above the fray
And name everyone who's throwing their chance away
I'm going to write my name on everything
I'm going to leave a lasting legacy
And when my body's thrown with great force from a window
The dogs will fight for whatever's left of me
Shallow grave among the weeds
Where the pale worms creep
Wake up and worship the great gold sheep


I'd really like to play along
Your ruby red mouth is full and moist
I'd like to give in to your oboe reed voice
But as sure as those are buzzards in the guava tree
You're looking real funny at me
1 2 3 4
That's not music you hear, that's the devil
That's not the sun up in the sky, it's a human heart
If you're planning your escape, you know I'm all for you
As I watch the sun come up again over Tallahassee, Florida


Window mounted air conditioning unit
Humming like a hive
We want to send postcards to the friends we used to have
Rub their noses in the ugly fact that we are still alive
And we play lovers reggae
On accordian and banjo
When the moon is high
And we lie on the floor
Get suspicious of the people
Who've just moved in next door
The bad taste in our mouths
The twinkle in your eye
Good things never last
Bad things never die

Wind chime from Tahiti that we found down at the auction
Tolls its minor chord
And I can't think of one thing in this whole wide blessed world
That's more dangerous and frightening
Than you when you get bored
And we go though scads of money
Don't know where it comes from
Don't know where it goes
And we stare, out the window
See the poison flowers the neighbours grow
Sprouting up in nice neat rows

The swelling in our limbs
The twinkle in your eye
Good things never last
Bad things never die


Autumn came around like a drifter to an onramp
There were wet leaves floating in gutters full of rain
Took to walking barefoot around town
Melodies from grade school, kicking in my brain
Saw you on the crosstown bus today
You were reading a magazine
I turned my face away and I shut my eyes tight
And dreamed about the flowers that hide from the light on dark hillsides
In the hidden places
The brakes howled and the bus pulled up near my house
And I got off at the corner
Pulled my sleeves down over my hands, over my hands
And I wished I was someone else
And I wished it was warmer
And when I got home, I thought about you
Like a desperate policeman, searching for clues
And I almost passed out, just then
And I shut my eyes again
Headed for the dark hillsides
In the hidden places


The jacaranda are wet with color
And the heat is a great paintbrush, lending color to our lives
And to the air, and to out faces; but I'm going to Alaska
Where there's snow to suck the sound out from the air

Up, yes, in the branches
The purple blossoms, go pale at the edges;
There is meaning in the shifting of the sap, and I see in them traces
Of last year; but then they hadn't grown so strong
And their limbs were more like wires. Now they are cables
Thick and alive with alien electricity
And I am going to Alaska, where you can go blind
Just by looking at the ground; where fat is eaten by itself
Just to keep the body warm
Because from where we are now, it seems, really
That everything is growing in a thousand different ways:
That the soil is soaked through with old blood and with relatives
Who were buried here, or close to here, and they are giving rise
To what is happening. Or can you tell me otherwise?
I am going to Alaska, where the animals can kill you
But they do so in silence, as though if no-one hears them
Then it really won't matter. I am going to Alaska!

They tell me that it's perfect for my purposes


One, two
One, two, three

Cause no trouble
Keep to our own kind
Known to exist
Hard to find
Neck deepinour passions
Serve whowe serve
Enshrouded in moonlight
Bucking the curve
Underthe radar
Just out of reach
Among the thick woods
A mile from the beach

The burden of exile
Gets easy to bear
Sometimes forget
There's cities down there
Woodsmen with axes
They come and they go
Snitch to the prefect
'Bout what they don't know
Smell the ocean breeze
We will never run out of trees

Under the radar
Just out of reach
Among the thick woods
A mile from the beach, yeah


Get accustomed to our shapes
Rained in 'til next week at the earliest
Go through an old box full of Betamax tapes
Pull the blankets up to my neck
And the screen began to glow
I cried real tears when they beat Chuck Norris down
Wait here in the shadows 'til the shadows let me go
And treat each crushing moment like a gift
And wait for the fog to lift
Pretend I'm waiting for a notice
From someone somewhere far away
Sit here and break things while I'm waiting
As day gives way to day gives way to day gives way to day
But though I try to let the shadows mask my movements
They're never gonna hide me like they used to
I watch the Delta Force save everybody from that plane on fire
I was watching wishing I had not lost track of you
I treat each crushing moment like a gift
And wait for the fog to lift


Kick in as the sun began to blaze
I saw you walk across the plaza
Figured I'd just play it like it lays
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I think I'm gonna be real sick again
I think it's gonna happen real soon
And I know I can't afford another night here in this place
With its sixteenth floor view of the ocean and the dunes
And it's gonna be just you and me today
Waiting for the other shoe to drop in Tampa Bay
I can hear the roar of the crowd
In the stadium a couple of blocks away
It's the kind of thing that used to get me all worked up
But I don't want to talk about it now, okay, okay?
Okay
I just want to get this whole thing over with
I don't want to deal with it anymore
I hear the cogs all slipping at the same time
And then I see you walk in through the door
And it's gonna be just you and me today
Waiting for the other shoe to drop in Tampa Bay



Listen, you can tell your lawyer
That he can go to hell
'Cause I can take whatever you are offering reasonably well
Four long years come to nothing
It's alright
But it's your birthday
It's your birthday tonight
And I went to buy you something
But I caught myself in time
Nothing makes any sense anymore
But everything rhymes
Die hard, die kicking
Old habit of mine
Die hard, die kicking
Old habit of mine
Die hard, die hard
Die kicking



Sun just clearing the treeline when my day begins
Slippery ice on the bridges, northeastern wind coming in
You will bruise my head, I will strike your heel
Drive past woods of northern pine, try not to let go of the wheel
Dream at night
Girl with a cobra tattoo on her arm
Its head flaring out like a parachute

Prisms in the dew drops in the underbrush
Skatecase sailor's purses floating down in the black needlerush
Higher than the stars I will set my throne
God does not need Abraham, God can raise children from stones
Dream at night
Girl with a cobra tattoo
And try to hear the garbled transmissions come through


You came down from heaven to the branch outside my window
Your feathers were the color of snow
The dice were loaded against us ever seeing each other
But one of us had nowhere else to go

In your eyes were all the colors the rainbow forgot
Your wingspan was three feet wide or better
With your voice practicing notes from time's own beginning
You took apart the alphabet letter by letter
And here, where it all stops for good
Where the cool waters run
Thought I saw a mouse kicking in your beak
It was only a skeleton


We were drinking Colorado Bulldogs
When inspiration struck
And we knew it was high time
For us to change our own luck
We cracked a couple Coca Colas open
Mixed em up with vodka and some coffee liqueur
Poured in some cold milk, raised our glasses high to old friends
My love for you is ninety-eight percent pure
But the two percent that remains
Has fried the circuits in my brain

I got out my smoking jacket
You put on some fishnets, and your smart black beret
We cut quite a figure in the mirror
And then we were on our way
Oh would that you would kiss me
With the kisses of your mouth
'Cause your mouth is sweeter than wine, and has
A more complicated history than the American South
As the evening took us in
You could have popped the tension with a safety pin


We went down to Pete Brown's Chevrolet
Cause Pete Brown can satisfy all your new car needs
We were nicely oiled by then
Our internal transponders picking up satellite feeds
From well worn ancient places
Our eager young sales rep handed us the keys
We drove about three-quarters of a mile
All that's left for us now are moments like these
We parked behind the high school, away from the light
And the flames climbed high into the night


Water dripping from the pipes down in the basement
Bare feet on a concrete floor
Notches on the wall of my solitary cell
Sweat dripping out of every pore

It feels like it takes forever
It's maybe five minutes on screen
But the horns will swell and the strings will sound
When that flipped quarter hits the ground
I'm doing this for revenge
I'm doing this to try and stay true
I'm doing this for the ones they had to leave behind
I'm doing this for you

Keep cool down in the quiet of the morning
Sweat blood when the sun comes through
Thick mist on the pond before the temple
Headed down for the final rendezvous

Everybody ready for justice
Just another mile to go
But the strings will keen and the horns will cry
When it's just me against the sky

I'm doing this for revenge
I'm doing this to try and stay true
I'm doing this for the ones they left to twist in the wind
I'm doing this for you

I'm doing this for you
You might also like
I'm doing this for revenge
I am doing this to try and stay true
I'm doing this for the ones we had to leave behind
I'm doing this for you

I'm doing this for you
I'm doing this for you


I got your letter
And I read what it said
And I blushed with recognition
At every word you said

And you are my best friend
And I have always known you

I dreamed of your house
And I looked around
And I felt the real rain rolling down
And you are my best friend
And I, I have always known you


The acrid smell of burning branches, the relics all in ruin
Broken blades atop the altar, cheap substitutions
And the tapestry above torn down, trampled, then re-hung
Now illegible forever, an oracle with no tongue

All of this, all of this
All of this before I got there

And in a pit behind the altar, the bodies of the fallen
Heavy tracks up to the lip just to prove that they were crawling
Faces turned toward the sky that they would never see again
Victims of the fallout, I have failed you sweet young men
All of this, all of this
All of this before I got there


Set out early, every seasoned rider knows
Keep an even pace, steady as she goes
Headed back to town after several nights away
I rode past you on the road again today

Gentle shadows in the mist among the trees
Who awakes prepared to face such sights as these?
God keep the bounty hunter who shows mercy to his prey
I rode past you on the road again today
And as you approached I could sense the threat
But a stranger's just a frind who hasn't shared their secrts yet

Make camp by sundown, watchfire burning bright
Songs bloom in the dark and throb down in the night
I seek the gate of wisdom, the secret state of play
I rode past you on the road again today

Rise up restless, get ready for the waterworks
Shun the hollow places where my marksman lurks
One of us will tire and one will rise and ride away
I rode past you on the road again today


On the morning you went away
The air was humid and the sky was gray
I had boiled peanuts for breakfast from Cairo, Georgia

The air was wet, my face was wetter
The pink flowers along the western window made me feel better
I turned the air conditioner on
Found the note on scented stationary - you were long gone
I had boiled peanuts for breakfast from Cairo, Georgia
I popped the top off of the aluminum can
Let the brine slide down my fingers, man
It was warm, it was warm on my skin
But I felt the cold blast looming on in
I had boiled peanuts for breakfast from Cairo, Georgia


Floor the pedal at the green light
Watch the traffic all drift right
Barrel forward unimpeded
Switch lanes as needed
Be flexible, be unreplaceable
In a world of heavy footprints, be untraceable

Wage war, get rich, die handsome
Wage war, get rich, die handsome
Wage wars, get rich, die handsome
Live once, you get to pay twice
Keep your nose clean, keep your wheels nice
Open highway on the horizon
Queen of queens, anima rising
Stay independent, make adjustments as needed
It's losers all the way down, you stay undefeated
Stay undefeated

Wage war, get rich, die handsome
Wage wars, get rich, die handsome
Wage wars, get rich, die handsome, go


Wage wars, get rich, die handsome
Wage war, get rich, die handsome
Wage wars, get rich, die handsome, die handsome


One, two
One, two, three

We move by night
Cover our tracks well and we pack light
Follow the shoreline 'til we've run clean out of land
Speak in gestures only we can understand

We've made mistakes
Everyone spots their own mess when the dawn breaks
We get so exhausted
Lost kids, just wasted
Sleep in short shifts and then rise up to our feet
Life is short, and life is hard, and life is sweet

The treeline shakes
We roll hard along some long odds when the dawn breaks

See soft peaks off in the distance
Those people in the mountains
They will never know what hit them

We shed dead weight
It gets pretty hard to concentrate
Practice our prayers until some small hope crystallizes
Follow the shoreline till some better hope arises

Behold, the beast awakes
Stand trapped in his great shadow when the dawn breaks


Get lost inside the pack
Pull at a carcass till my toothbreaks
Yourgrown-up teeth --
Theydon't grow back
They don't grow back
Finda clearing in the forest
Wait for word from the battlefront
Sing to the moon until your throat's raw
The Lord of the manor --
He won't be coming back from the hunt
He won't be coming home from the hunt
Soon it'll be my time to go
I know
Breach the perimeter with my brethren
Know who your friends are when you need them
Sleep soundly with the enemy
And remember me --
Too dumb to trade his cloak for freedom
Too dumb to trade his cloak for freedom
Run, run ahead, all of you --
I'll catch up when I'm able to
Seek the manor grounds anew
Too dark to find the path
Sleep on the road and dream
The only dream worth dreaming --
The thronging plain
The bloodbath
Soon it'll be my time to go
I know


"Almost missed this one," he said
I stared at the honky-tonk piano
Sure beats living in town
The beaches are half a mile away
"Not much of the cat," I said
He stared down underneath the couch
It doesn't matter much to me
Not gonna beat it, anyway

"It's called 'quintessence'," I said
She stared at an Oreo cookie in black and white
After water, earth, air and fire
The fifth and highest play
"Lobster okay?", she said
I stared at her refrigerator door
There'll be enough for the guy in the attic
What's his name?

It only takes a few cents more to go first class
First class only takes a few
It only takes a few cents more to go first class
First class only takes a few

Shared a floor with Nashville
The burger queen bought herself a pearl
A bloke named Boob McNutt bounced in
With art and a very pretty Kelly girl
Downstairs, two Spanish lovers were singing along
With some domestic Don Juan
I had to pinch myself, what a hell of a house I'd stumbled on

"June, July, August," she said
They stared at the summer about to fade away
Damn good three months of my life
I remember now what living is
"The cat's now a cat," I say
You stare at the honky-tonk piano man
Watch your step
I just met Oliver, the lobster's his

Everything's going to be alright
Came back to the place where it all flared up
Just to check if the reservoir still bore the mark of the drought
Up to 13th and Taylor, checked my pulse
You weren't there, and neither was anybody else
Stared down demons, came back breathing
No real point in ever leaving
Tracy and Ivory and Brad and me too
We will see some great miracle before the night is through
Slipped in through the entrance, stood in the hall
Left my fingerprints on the elevator wall
Went to my old room, stood outside it a minute
Wondering if parts of me were still there in it
Who can say it won't be me?
You are gone now and I am free
Wesley and Quinn and Devin and you
We will all be fixed up as good as new
And I stared at the number 10 on my old apartment's door
There's one ghost that can't bite me anymore
And some day we will all feel at home in our new skin
And some day we will all never be alone again
When the sun comes up and the night has passed
We shall all be healed at last, at last, at last


I live outside of town where the straight highway curves
Three years I lived nextdoor to the airport
So nothing you can say to me can get on my nerves
Stay 'till you feel your legs underneath you again
I've got room in my house for you
I've got a Kenmore single-room window unit air conditioner
It cools down the place in the full heat of day
A family of possums have made a home underneath the front steps
They are majestic in their own beady-eyed homely way
Stay 'till you can breathe like normal people do
I've got room in my house for you
They tore down the airport in 1981
This is where I came when I ran out of places to run
Come, come
Come and stay with me out here away from things
Come and stay with me where the sky's real clear
I live way out where no one believes anybody could live
Sky's purple from six in the evening 'till midnight out here
Stay 'till the world goes down in flames
I've got room, room in my house for you


Down in the lab with the hopeful few
Hell bent on doing the work that you cowards won't do
Weaving the future from bright new threads
Prices on their heads

Someday the abomination is going to finally make land
We stay silent as a snowdrift, focused on the task at hand
Dream of the day when the calm waters break
And something rises from the lake
Someday all of you people will know
The safe way isn't the only way to go

Movement in the grid as fish leap in th air
It's only a test run and still the tension's too dlicious to bear
All around the monitor station, big smiles, high fives
According to my projections, everybody's going to run for their lives

Still we wait until our time has come
Down here where the engines hum
Exiled priests of Rome
Bringing our troubles back home

Someday all of you people will know
The safe way isn't the only way to go


Life is too short to refrain from eating jam out of the jar
Life is too short to refrain from eating jam out of the jar
And life is too short to wait around for you to come home tonight
Life is too short
Too short to do that

Life is too short to leave the windows open all winter long
Life is too short to leave the windows open all winter long
I'm gonna lock 'em up tight and eat jam out of the jar all night
Cause life is too short to make toast
Or use spoons or napkins
Life is too short to spend the rest of it down here in tampa
Life is too short to spend the rest of it down here in tampa
Yeah, life is too short to let it go to waste like this
But I never tasted jam before that tastes like this
And life is too short to refrain from eating jam out of the jar


Cower in the corner
Try hard to disappear
The moment’s never going to come
When anyone can say that the coast is clear
Maybe turn around
Find a wall to break your fist on

Almost every door’s an exit
Just not this one
Dream about the outside
Sprinting down the open plain
Barefoot and outclassed
Bloody up the broken grain
Every cartoon keg
TNT and nitroglycerin

Almost every door’s an exit
Just not this one

Pause before each door
Like a sinner lost in prayer
Always one more hallway
At the bottom of the stair

I get knocked down
But I get up again like a dunce
Cave’s all sealed up
Nowhere to hide out in the winter months
Aiming for the blackout
Spare a prayer for souls in prison
You might also like
Almost every door’s an exit
Just not this one



He hit me right in the face
I drove the Falcon up Towne
Hung out in the library parking lot
The swelling'll never go down
Pint of Hiram Walker's in the lining
Of my father's old corduroy coat
Big, big plans hatching in my brain
And a big ugly lump in my throat
I drove up to Harvey Mudd and I played pinball
Till I didn't want to kill anyone
Polished off all my cheap whiskey
And stepped out into the California sun
Singing bainne na mbó ar na gamhna
And the juice of the barley for me
Singing bainne na mbó ar na gamhna
And the juice of the barley for me

My thirst carried me up the coast
Where it only got sharper, god damn it
In a small room that got even smaller
A block away from the Wilamette
There was nowhere I needed to go
And nowhere I wanted to be
From my window looked out upon nothing
And nothing looked right back at me
I had a couple of things on my mind
A couple of problems to think through
And I drank 'till I couldn't see straight anymore --
Until there was nothing to drink to

Singing bainne na mbó ar na gamhna
And the juice of the barley for me
Singing bainne na mbó ar na gamhna
And the juice of the barley for me
Hey!


They told me to teach you everything I know
Let the fire rain down
Rain down
Watched it flare up inside his heart
Saw it tearing him completely apart
Head to toe
I know
And blood will run
Through the streets of Rome today
And roll across the ocean
Fourteen years ago tonight
Watched him tearing through the garden
Killing everything in sight
I let my curiosity
Get the best of me
I saw the sourceless anger eating at him from inside
No one around him to stem the rising tide
Evil from his head down to his feet
Quinine's bitter, sugar's sweet
And blood will run
Through the streets of Rome today
And roll across the ocean


You and me are in a lot of trouble
And somebody's gonna burst our bubble
Your husband, my wife
My marriage, your life

Let's go to Maine out on the East Coast
Let's go to Maine right now
Let's beat the retreat
Let's hop on the plane
Let's get out of here
Let's go to Maine
Someone knows what's going on
Someone knows, and someone's gonna tell
Someone's gonna wrap us up in styrofoam and paper
And mail us flat-rate right down to hell

Let's go to Maine out on the East Coast
Let's go to Maine right now
Let's beat the retreat
Let's hop on the plane
Let's get out of here
Let's go to Maine


Melted off seven weeks ago
And the geese are headed north again
Through the tightening sky
And I can feel my heart in my throat again
New onions growing in the ground
The cows come gingerly out of the barn
And when they see that the ground is warm
They pick up a little speed, it makes me feel so good
And I feel it rushing down my throat, fresh blood
I head out onto the earth
Its cold heart is melting
I don't know if I can stand it
Springtime's coming
That means you'll be coming back around
New onions growing underground
Underground


When this is over
When we leave this all behind us
Deep in the moonless night
When the rescue team finds us

It's gonna get so dark for you
I’m gonna leave a mark on you
I'm gonna leave a mark on you
Can't trust anybody
Even the tough ones crack
Train up a swordsman
To stab you in the back
I na-na-na-na-know this much is true
I’m gonna leave a mark on you

No man knows the hour or the day
But the mark is gonna be visible
From several blocks away

Maybe you'll make it
To the far side of the hill
Maybe you will see me coming
But I don't think you will
Make peac with your family
You walk softly on this earth

I'm gonna leave a mark on you
I'm gonna lave a mark on you
I'm gonna leave a mark on you (On you, on you)
I'm gonna leave a mark on you


Bag full of oily rags, fifty cent lighter
Dreams of retirement in Cancun burning ever brighter
There's a lot of ways to make money in this world
But I can't recommend insurance fraud

Burned-out shell of a Volkswagen
Blood stains on the driveway
Torn up Mercedes, by the side of the highway
Big plans, big plans
Let me tell you something, sister
You will never get away with it
You were sitting in the recliner with the TV on
When you said something evil and then you were gone
Explosives in the water main
A blown fuse
College graduation photograph
Splashed all over the six o'clock news
I won't be cashing in your policy
Till I find out what it is you're trying to do to me


When I ask you to look at me
You look away
I ask you to tell me something nice once
You come at me with all your hot lights on display

I know you're changing
Damn you
I know you're changing
Goddamn you for that
When the snow stacked up outside
You looked around
I could see you from the window
I could see the snow coming down

I know you're changing
Damn you
I know you're changing
Goddamn you


Where all summer long it's so hot that you can't think straight
Where we pumped water from a well by hand
Half a world away from the old promised land
We understand we've been given
A new covenant, a real sharp one
And we spend our days and nights
Gaining new appreciation of its finer points
And waiting for the dead to rise up from their graves
Waiting for Jesus to come along and save us and
Biding our time, biding our time
Biding our time as best we know how
Where the Texas doughboys used to play
Before the wind blew everything away
Where we came to get away from our friends
Where we'd tell each other jokes waiting for the world to end
We know our jokes are funny
But in all the wrong ways and for all the wrong reasons
And we watch old George Romero movies
And relish the short time left
Yeah, waiting for the dead to rise up from their graves
Waiting for Jesus to come along and save us. yes, and
Biding our time, biding our time
Biding our time as best we know how


Everything I've told you was true
So imagine my surprise when I blink my eyes
And realize that I've been talking to you
And I've told you everything
Even the parts I'd meant to leave out
And I shake my hair, and I look about

And the wild dogs are hungry
And the wild dogs howl
And the wild dogs in the mountains to the north of us come down


There will be blue skies
Above the green and verdant plain
Churns will swell with fresh butter
There will be an abundance of sweet grain
And we will rise from our sleep
We won't have time to choose what things we'll keep

And rivers will all turn to blood
Frogs will fall from the sky
And the plague will rage through the countryside
La la la la
La la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la
There will be cotton clouds
Above the fields as white as cream
There will be loud singing in the churches
As we all come out to take one for the team
And all our great schemes and plans
Will slip like fishes from our hands

And rivers will all turn to blood
Frogs will fall from the sky
And the plague will cover the country with its anger
La la la la
La la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la
Hey


I saw your arms hanging at your side
Nowhere to run to, baby, nowhere to hide
Saw you moving, real slow
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to go
I heard the wind blow
I saw your sash come untied
Blue water, white sky

Up in the cedars we were too far away
For the radio to tell us the time of day
But there was moisture in the air
And I heard the city call
They could go on burning
To hell with them all
Your liquid movements
The water rushing by
Blue water, white sky
World's surface was as smooth as glass
They saw the hour coming and they didn't let it pass
I heard you say my name twice through your teeth
I saw you coming down to me, I was underneath you
It's been coming for some time
You close your eyes
Blue water, white sky

I heard the wind blow
I saw your sash come untied
Blue water, white sky



I saw you in the blazing light
When the lotus caught fire in the middle of the night

It froze me
It froze me

I saw you coming closer real slow
You grabbed hold, I let go
Yeah, I saw you in the blazing light
I saw you, I saw you, all right
It froze me
It froze me
It froze me
It froze me



Comes out muffled when they speak
The way we take our diminishing inventories
Month to month and week to week
The Maria Callas record's
On the stereo all the time
You're gonna get yours
And I'm gonna get mine
'Cause in this car, in this car
Somebody's bound to get burned
I know, I know
'Cause I've been watching the road turn
The Enigma Variations
On the radio
The things that I could guess at
The things that I already know
And the twelve thousand dollars
That turned up in your purse
You've done something awful
I've done something worse
And in this car, in this car
Somebody's bound to get burned
I know, I know
'Cause I've been watching the road turn


I will sail to the far shore
And I will chop a hole in the hull too big to repair
And I will turn the soil with my hands
And I will make my home there

My garden will grow so high
My garden will grow so high
That I will be completely hidden
I will go where I will go
And I will jettison all dead weight
And I will use these words for kindling
And I will sleep by the garden gate

My garden will grow so high
My garden will grow so high
That I will be completely hidden


On the hallway closet floor
Lie to the cops
When they're at your door
Throwcrumbs
Getthe hounds offmy tail
Make sure the coast isclear
Before you get my mail
Harbor me when I'm hungry
Harbor mewhenI'mhunted
Grab some shades
Fromthe gas stationrack
Living in fear
Till you come back
Sound of the key
Like an orchestral cue
Into the daylight
Thank God it's you
Harbor me when I'm shaken
Harbor me when I'm lost
Never see the day before dark
Every fugitive hour leaves its mark
Coded marks on a map
Written in my own hand
Parse it for days
Still can't understand
Bring me a candle
Bring me a match
Bring me some gasoline
Down the hatch
You might also likeHarbor me when I'm breathless
Harbor me when I'm choking


I saw you on TV
Doing a bad imitation of Van Morrison
And I saw you on TV
Doing a bad imitation of a second rate songwriter from the Eighties named Morrissey
I never liked Morrissey

And I don't like you

I saw you TV
Doing an imitation of an imitation of Jimi Hendrix
That's really pathetic
And I saw you on TV
Trying to figure out what Brian Jones would be like if he'd have lived til today
I can tell you myself
He'd be like Brian Wilson
I don't like Brian Wilson
And I don't like you
I don't like you


There may come a day someday
When we all look back and laugh
But there's lots of noise in the break room
Nasty points on the graph

And they're breaking into the broadcast now
Special update from Action News!
Some of what you'll hear in the footage that follows
May not reflect our station's views
We may run out of bullets
We're never going to run out of hostages

There's disagreements on procedure
Vocal, bitter divisions
As is often the case in situations lik this one
I'll be the on who makes the final decision

Some of you have been here before
Most of you have not
Some will dwell on the details in the future
Or work to keep it out of your thoughts

We may run out of bullets
We're never going to run out of hostages

If there's one thing I love
It's an infinite resource
If there's one thing worth loving
It's a surplus of supplies
You might also like
There's a team up on the rooftop
Good luck to the team
When you know you'll never make it out alive
You kind of get to live out your dream

Helicopters in the distance
Music of the spheres on the wind
It's gonna be a rough ride from here down to the exit
Some might look back and laugh at the end

We may run out of bullets
We're never going to run out of hostages


I was sitting in the street when the news came my way
Good news
Good news
Good news
Good news
I was sitting in the street when the messenger came by
I was sitting in the street when the messenger came my way
Good news
Good news like a rare blood disorder
Good news
Good news
I was sitting in the street
I don't believe I've made it clear what exactly I mean by that
I was sitting in the middle of the street
Dust made its way into my legs even though my shirt was tucked in
And I saw the colors forming in the west
Saw the bright feathers reflected in the sky, now
Good news
Good news

I'm coming in
Try to stop me
Push furniture in front of the door
It only gives me something to push against
In the full heat of the summer's day
You're telling me to go away
But you owe me eight thousand dollars
And I can use it

I'm only getting stronger
You may have noticed
But a head full of memories propels me ever further
And in the living room I don't see where you are
But the back door's locked, so you can't have gone far
And eight thousand dollars is a whole lot of money
And I could use it
Could be that it's my imagination, but I think I hear you now
So come out, come out, wherever you are
Olly-olly-olly-olly-olly-olly oxen free see I'm
Perfectly aware of where our love stands
But the plain fact is that you owe me eight grand
If it helps to jog your memory
I lent it to you on Tuesday, when we were drinking

Ha!
Ha-ha-ha-uh-uh-ha!
Uh-ha! Uh-ha! Uh uh uh-ha!
Uh-ha! Ha ha ha
Ha ha ha
Uh-ha
Uh-ha
Uh-ha

Me and the Sergeant dropped to the ground
In the shadow below a bush
I heard a branch crack to the left
Then the sound of footsteps
Two of the renegades carrying firewood, a third with a lightbulb
Were walking toward them
Closer and closer


Tunneled down into the core
Flying through the trap door
Soft, pink sky full of rumpled clouds
Radio up loud

There's a pop in the speakers
Where I hear your voice come through, so brave and true
When did I lose sight of you?
Come and rattle your chain all you want
You're always gonna be welcomed
Here in the hallways that you used to haunt
Ride the sentimental rodeo
Down to where the shadows grow
Long while since I felt this way
Stand by the window, wait for days

There's a pop in the speakers
Where I hear your voice come through, so brave and true
Let me never lose sight of you
Come and battle your chain all you want
You're always gonna be welcomed
Here in the hallways that you used to haunt


Let the tube lights buzz overhead
Tell the papers that you’re dead
You’d want them to be the first to know
Gone down where the goblins go

Head down, headed for the curtain call
I’m the last to try to break your fall
Last high tide before the undertow
Gone down where the goblins go
If I had as much money as I could spend
I never would cry
I never would choose to mend

There’s no kingdom, there’s no road
Just old sets where faulty flash pots explode
Head out to the sidewalk
On with the show
Gone down where the goblins go
Gone down where the goblins go

If I had as much money as I could spend
I never would cry
I never would choose to mend

There’s no kingdom, there’s no road
Just old sets where faulty flash pots explode
Head out to the sidewalk
On with the show
Gone down where the goblins go
Gone down where the goblins go



Lying in the hot sun today
Watching the clouds run away
Thought a little while about you
The sky was a petrifying blue
And while the geese flew past
For no reason at all, I let the sky fall
This is an empty country
And I am the king, and I should not
Be allowed to touch anything
I picked myself up off the ground
Shook the grass from my hair and I walked around
Felt the warm sun in my eye
Strangers were passing by
I shimmied up the black walnut tree
Let the hard blue sky fall right through me
And I saw the sad young cardinals trying to sing
And I should not be allowed to touch anything



And the heat came down
I knew I was living in a long, long dream
When you fed me the black ice cream
And the heat rose up
And the heat rose up
I heard the loud, loud buzzing of our son's go-kart
And the ice cream was blacker than the devil's heart
It was August the 19th, 1957
I fixed my eyes on you, fixed my eyes on you


I'm going to rise up early every day
Overcome every obstacle in my way
Keep a secret chamber in my heart clean
Polish every surface to a brilliant sheen

Remain positive and stay on the grind
Banish every other thought from my mind

I'm going to make you suffer
I'm going to make you suffer
Let your yes be yes and let your no come from deep in your belly
I'm going to make you suffer
There was a captain many years at sea
Living the life of th sailor, rugged and free
Nothing but the sky to sing him to sleep at night
Safe in th arms of the ocean, no land in sight

Out on the waves you try to keep warm
Nobody here to sound the alarm

I'm going to make you suffer
I'm going to make you suffer
The first in line will receive the full brunt of the blow
I'm going to make you suffer

Woke up from a dream whimpering like an infant
Over time people tell me their dreams grow distant
And they learn to love the lives they lead
No more hungry ghosts in the chimney to feed

You often hear stories like these
Someday I will see you on your knees
You might also like
I'm going to make you suffer
I'm going to make you suffer
Say what you like, there won't be anybody listening
I'm going to make you suffer


Hoisting my body up atop the charred debris
Who is that creature with the crazed look in his eyes?
Don't even question your senses, you can be sure that's me
When all the pretenders to your hand
Lie dead across the land
I'll be the last man on earth
I'll be the last man on earth
I'll be the last man on earth
Crawling around, down on the ground
When the Hail Marys you've been saying lose their savor
Just when your dungeon walls feel like they're closing in
Whose are those bloody knuckles reaching down to grab you
Just as the last of the light overhead is growing dim?
It was their love you wanted, not mine
But when they deny your name three times
I'll be the last man on earth
I'll be the last man on earth
I'll be the last man on earth
Crawling around, down on the ground
And I will throw you across my shoulders
And I will bleed and I will drool
And the cameras will slow pan across my face
And I will try to say something cool
Just as the hordes of thirsting demons close around us
Raising their axes, howling like monkeys in the sun
Who will that guy be holding you so high above them?
You know and I know, everyone knows it, I'm the one
I may have failed you once before
But this right here, this means war
You might also likeI'll be the last man on earth
I'll be the last man on earth
I'll be the last man on earth
Crawling around, down on the ground


I went down to Lloyd Center looking for you
But a mouth full of anger blocked my view
He took your hand there in the skating the rink

God will give him blood to drink

Saw the two of you leaving
I didn't want to follow behind
But I could see the rest of your evening
Burning in my mind
The sky's black, the moon's pink
God will give him blood to drink

I looked over the railing, ice was white
On the northeast side where I saw you and your boyfriend
On a friday night
I went mining for gold; I struck pure, fresh zinc

God, god will give him blood to drink

Hey, hey, hey


I hung pictures of you from every lamp post in town
As the humidity climbed into numbers I don't care to repeat
The air was heavy and the sky was alive
And the Pacific Starlight train wasn't due in till 11:45

I thought about how cold you must be
I thought about things I thought that I'd soon be forgetting
I thought of you up in Canada
As the lightning storms lit up all downtown Redding
There were teenagers in mini-trucks coming around every corner
You can taste the adrenaline coming out through their skin
I came to the well-lit doorway of a sheet music store
Saw my face in the glass, sat down in the doorway and I settled in

I thought about how cold you must be
I thought about things I thought that I'd soon be forgetting
I thought of you up in Canada
As the lightning storms lit up all downtown Redding


73 years before the advent of the Christian era
As Rome was taking over any land within reach
Setting up proxy governments in the conquered lands
There lived one such man given just such a job
Gaius Verres, go

A praetor held a position which operated on trust
He was to govern instead of the emperor himself
It was an easy, easy privilege to abuse
And Verres did so
He was the governor of Agrigentum
Which we now know as Sicily
And he stole everything that wasn't nailed down
Took improper advantage of other men's wives
The list goes on, trust me
Cicero wrote it all down

At Syracuse, Verres welcomed a band of pirates
They all drank and danced and sang on the shore
And when the husband of one of Verres's paramours came
Bringing a fleet of boats with him
Verres, clever, if diabolical, gave him a job
And enlisted the pirates to burn the whole fleet down

The boats burned in the Sicilian harbor
The flames rose hundreds of feet into the air
We stood on the shore, watching them burn
We stood on the shore, we heard the old songs
Hey


I was sitting at the edge of the marsh
When the council came to bring me the news
They handed me a bowl of cooked wild grasses
And they gave me the ceremonial shoes


Goodbye young Danish women
Goodbye Danish sky
Goodbye cold air, I am going away
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye


The garter snake passed lazily
Through the tall yellow-headed sourgrass
There was cold, clear water in a tall, clean glass
The sunlight hit the sides
And it came through the water tilted
I saw the condensation on your hand
I could feel the glaciers melting

And a warm, soft wind
Covered up everything
On the day your love came screaming through me
You had oranges and lemons in a canvas bag beside you
And seven different kinds of light welling up inside of you
You smeared citrus pulp all over me, it felt okay
Good old east Rutherford three thousand miles away

I felt the warm surge blast my mind
Coming in from behind
On the day your love came screaming through me

In the fresh light of day
I felt something falling away
On the day your love came screaming through me


When you were 19, I first laid eyes on you
The small stream that ran through the center of town carried your name to me
Your hair was dark and your eyes were a frosty blue
Then they put me in jail until you were 23

When you were 24, we took to drinking and dancing
We boxed with our shadows like a couple of kangaroos
And then we went down to Chechnya for the weekend
Your eyes were glacial and your promises all rang true
And things are happening here while we sleep
I can feel it in my boiling brain
And I am dreaming in blood-red color
When I see the Stolypin car riding through the light rain
They'll have to carry me out on my back
They'll have to tear me to pieces, all right
We are warm in our hidden room down here
We've got stars in our eyes tonight



You've had it up to here with my West Country talk
You can hardly understand a word I say
The shortest tree around here is a hundred feet tall
It's gonna rain today
I try and tell you secrets until my face turns blue
I am not getting through to you
All the way across the ocean, they're gathering their strength again
Lining up along the country's length again

This morning I know who you are
This morning I know who you are
On the river, the sun is bright gold
And the things you try to say to me make my blood run cold
But I hold you anyway
And we stare into the sun all day
And you're about to leave again, I've learned to read your movements
And I'm learning how to read your mind
The sun climbs the sky for us, above the Mississippi
And I can feel you in my arms but you're hardly even with me

This morning I know who you are
This morning I know who you are




A bird you would have liked brought the sky down
But it was useless to see it without you around
And in the unstoppable camera of my mind's eye
I saw you and some foreign guy

And I could hear your voice ringing
I could hear you singing
From all away across the country in Palm Springs
I could hear you now

Your laughter tore through the New Jersey night
And I can't stand it, but I'm all right
Stood out on the balcony and I took a look around
And a bird we would have loved the sight of brought the sky down

And I could hear your voice ringing
I could hear you singing
From all away across the country in Palm Springs
I could hear you now



Sun melts everything down
And the hills are reduced to nothing
The whole house shakes
And you can see that the coach is coming
You lean down and you pick up
The small soft eggs in the dust outside my door
I hold them in my hands
They are warm and the air is warming up now

I've got a message for you
If I could only remember
I've got a message for you
But you're gonna have to come and get it
La la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la
Ever since I came here
All I could think about is water
Last night they brought the fat lamb in from the fold
But I couldn't bring myself to do anything about it
I remember California, I remember Malibu
I remember the states and the names of the cities
But I don't remember you

And I've got a message for you
If I could only remember
I've got a message for you
But you're gonna have to come and get it
I've got a message for you
I've got a message for you, 2 3 4
La la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la


There was a barn owl trapped in the rafters
The ground underneath us was wet and cold
We'd heard the owl thrashing about, trying desperately to get out
We stood outside and watched the night unfold

We watched the sun go down on Scotland
And I watched the moon come up over you
When a pack of dogs went silently past us, we knew we'd been given fair warning
But that was the only thing we knew
And you threw all your luggage out onto the water
And I tore the shirt away from my back
The cold came on with a new found intensity and you pressed your warm body against me
And I loved you so much it was making me sick

We watched the sun go down on Scotland
We were glad that we'd left Oklahoma behind
I took your hips in my hands and I threw you down to the new found, rich brown, deep, wet ground
Had a vision of you burning on my mind

We watched the sun go down on Scotland
And I watched the moon come up over you
When a pack of dogs went silently past us, we knew we'd been given fair warning
But that was the only thing we knew


I'm gonna drink more whiskey than Brendan Behan
I'm gonna send my belongings all to Tripoli and
I'm gonna ride home to California
With a banjo on my knee
I'm never gonna turn off the television
I'm just gonna let it run all night
I'm gonna plant root vegetables out in the backyard
And come summer I am going to treat you right

So put on your Chairman Mao coat
And let me clear my throat
Let's turn this whole town upside-down
Shake it 'til the coins come falling out of its pockets
Yeah put on your Che Guevara pin
Call the troops on in
We're gonna sail through the night sky like a pair of bottle rockets
I got a great big secret written down somewhere
I got a rosary to protect us both from harm
I got a storage locker full of cow figurines
And a laundry list of grievances longer than my arm
And I am never going back to Cincinatti
All those bridges have burned down to the ground
I got that jet pack strapped to my back
And I'm waiting for you to come around

Yeah, put on your Chairman Mao coat
And let me clear my throat
Let's turn this whole place upside-down
And shake it 'til the coins come dropping out of its pockets
Yeah put on your Che Guevara pin
Call the troops on in
We're gonna sail through the night sky like a pair of bottle rockets


The ghostly sing-song
Of the children playing double-dutch
I felt the wind come through the window
I felt it turn around and switch back
In the second story room
In Jamaica, Queens
Your hair was dripping wet
Your skin was clean

And the children skipping rope
Tripled their speed
You were all I'd ever wanted
You were all I'd ever need
In New York City in the middle of July
The air was heavy and wet
The air was heavy, your body was heavy on mine
I will know who you are yet, I will know who you are yet


My hand brushes against the lock of hair
That hangs down past your ear to your jaw
My hand brushes against the lock of hair
That hangs down past your ear to your jaw
It's real neat
The moment's sweet but it's all wrong

And we're pictures of decency when we wave goodbye outside
We're pictures of decency when we wave goodbye outside
Yeah, I'm the model of composure out there
But you oughta see me shaking later on
My brain gets flooded six hours later
My brain gets flooded over six hours later
And rivers run with pictures of you as I stare up at the blood-red moon
Lying out front on the lawn
Hey


First thing that happened was the river overflowed
The water running through the streets and was sweet and cold
I knelt by the water like a doe by a stream
Punch-drunk, snowblind, as though the whole thing were a bad dream

And then love called out the heavy artillery
And Kypris took the horses by the bit for the morning ride
I count my blessings but you can only be expected to count so high
When love cuts the strings
I smeared myself with pennyroyal to keep the hounds at bay
And you poked your head out of an alley half a block away
And I recognized you though I'm not sure how
And the air turned red around you
As a dull chill came down over me

And then love summoned up the infantry
And the green-eyed goddess got ready for all-out war
I count my blessings
But I don't even know what the word blessing means
When love cuts the strings

Yeah!


"… me, he touched me, and suddenly…"

It's a cold night in Sonora
And the stars are out in full force
It's a moment the world has been waiting for
When you set the world back on course
Into the fire you go, into the fire you go

It's a strange gathering around you
And the lord of the snails is born
Five minutes before you take on divinity
You hear the crackling, well, you hear the snapping corn
Into the fire you go, into the fire you go
Into the fire you go, into the fire you go


I got off work just past eleven
Laid one finger to the breeze
You can almost taste the action
On nights like these
Trees were bending in the wind
You were forty miles away
And I was headed in your direction
I've been waiting all day, I've been waiting all day

Moon over West Covina
Was huge and white
And I was like a patient on a table
Headed for the light
Lean toward the center divider
Feel the wind in my hair
Keep a light up in your window
I'm gonna be right there, I'm gonna be right there
With a gleam in my eye
And an almost airtight alibi

Down by the chemistry building
I found a quiet place to park
And I made my way down the street toward your place
Stepping lightly in the dark
Climbed the steps up to your doorway
Like a man prepared to jump beneath a train
It's real warm outside tonight
Maybe tomorrow it rains, maybe tomorrow it rains

Inside your room we shut the window
And we turned on a fan
And we lay there together in the darkness
I can keep a secret if you can
Finishing one another's sentences
Like a pair of identical twins
Your boyfriend's out of town until Tuesday
And nobody saw me come in, nobody saw me come in

With a gleam in my eye
And an almost airtight alibi


In the five minutes worth of lost time that I had
When I was passed out on the supermarket floor
I saw you at the head of the heavenly chorus
And I heard your song ringing all through the store
In the five minutes when my broadcast got pre-empted
I saw you touch down. you were no longer dead
I was happy to see ya. I had lots of questions
And I put my hand to the wound in your head

Ah, the blood!
All of that blood!
All of that warm blood flowing freely from you
In the five minutes when I was dead to the world
In a place far away from my friends and my home
I saw you with a smile on your radiant face
Amidst all of the cans and the glass and the chrome
And in those five minutes, my signal was jammed
The frequencies that I received were so pure
That I almost believed that the sight of the hole in your skull
Was a thing that my heart could endure

Ah, the blood!
All of that blood!
All of that warm blood flowing freely from you!


When I was twelve years old
They put me on the throne
When I was twelve years old
They made me king
From the ocean south of here to the northern hemisphere
They gave me everything
Now I'm thirteen
And no one takes me seriously
Now I'm thirteen
And they're trying to take away control
I don't know how stupid
You all think I am
But as sure as flowers grow along the western wall
Heads are gonna roll
Yeah


You never learn to tell the difference between
The probable projections and the best parts of the dream
The fragments that stick with you, the ones you really feel
Those parts aren't real

But high in the cold Midwestern air
They shimmer before us there
Almost out of reach but not quite
Stay up thinking about it all night
Waited so long for days like these
I'm tired of living on my knees
Pull your hair back tight
Head right for the extraction point
And if you don't hear from me
Let them all go free

I'm on the Kennedy Expressway at dawn
Don't know where we got this car from, I'm driving with the fog lights on
The angles you don't plan for, the things you might have missed
Those things exist

But under the waxing winter sun
I feel like we're almost gone
Just pick a lane and drive right through
Headed off to freedom with you
Dreams of the future up in the front of my mind
Leave a couple dozen bodies behind

Pull your hair back tight
Head right for the extraction point
And if you don't hear from me
Let them all go free


Cool air falls through the venetian blinds and the
Planets in the heavens are perfectly aligned
I take in my surroundings
I memorize them all
The scuff marks on the stone floor
The powder burns on the eastern wall

There's a monkey in the basement
How did the monkey get there?
There's a monkey in the basement
Where did the monkey come from?
Where did the monkey come from?
Where did the monkey come from?
The animal noises you used to make
The Andalusian coral snake
All pale when standing beside this room
And the heavy hot rains and the sonic boom

There's a monkey in the basement
Where did the monkey come from?
There's a monkey in the basement
How did the monkey get there?
How did the monkey get there?
How did the monkey get there?


One day in September you come here
You pull my head down and you whisper in my ear
And you tell me the sidewalk is as far as the world really goes
But that's a secret everybody knows

You hold my head in your hands, you say my name
How is it that though you say it some 20,000 times
It's never quite the same?
And you tell me that Hercules died burning
Consumed by an article of his own clothing
That's something I'd rather not be reminded of


There was a new song on the air
I saw you coming across the square
And a white bird broke the dark Korean sky
As the rest of my life went by

You had your warm hand on my face
I took your index finger in between my teeth
And I held it gently in place
It was resting lightly on my tongue in there
I saw you shaking in the cold Korean air
There but for the grace of the lord of song
I would be this very second and I'm coming right along
You had your cardigan on
I looked toward the sky and the white bird was gone
I remember your eyelids
I remember your body now


Crushing strawberries one by one
Watching the juice drip down
Two and a half months ahead of schedule
The leaves on the trees are turning brown
We got ready for winter
As the sun rose up in the sky
There was something almost soothing in the hard to define
Note of terror in your eye
Watching the strawberries lose their shape
As the wind blew through the elm tree
The wind was far too cold for the middle of April
And you reached out your hand to me
It was good to feel your hand in mine
It was good to know you felt the chill too
I scooped up a palmful of strawberry pulp
And smeared it all over you

The wild strawberries drove me on
As I lapped them up off of your skin
And I could feel your basal body temperature rise
As the cold came in
Hey hey



Down in the South Bronx
Down home
Saw you walking down the street again
Saw you looking sweet again

I saw you coming through
I turned my head away from you
Why do you come here?
Why do you come around?
Why'd you go home?
Why'd you head on home to Rockaway?



Most of the brine has got to boil away
Most of the air has got to choke you
Most of June I spent in jail again
I don't mean jail, exactly
Up in the pine tree
Red squirrel looking down at me

I am losing control of the language again
I am losing control of the language again
Most of the things I used to hold onto
Most of the things I used to say to you
Most of the ways I knew around the local roads
Are disappearing daily
High in the cottonwood
You were looking down at me and you sure looked good
Hair hanging down in the leaves
Your neck tilted back to make a rainbow

I was losing control of the language again
I am losing control of the language again


I will rise from the swamp
Where they dumped my private plane
I'll be clutching the life preserver in my teeth
And I will find the highway
And I will flag down a truck
Worry lines on my forehead
Blank stare underneath

And when I come back to town
I'm gonna cast my burden down
A little worse for wear
Practically walking on air
I will thank my ride
And crawl my way back inside
To the guts of the building
Where my enemies hide in the dark like roaches
And I will signal the camera crew
And everyone will do what he's been trained how to do
Sweat dripping from my face
As my moment approaches

Click your heels, count to three
I bet you never expected me
A little worse for wear
Practically walking on air


I know you see Mars in the sky tonight
I know you can see Venus rising and veering off to the right
But can you see that young star overhead?
It's the one that designed my undoing

I know that in California the waves break on the beach
And I know that the foam on the breaking waves is as white as household bleach
But do you see that particular white right now?
It's the color of the young star coming on down
I got joy, joy, joy in my soul tonight
I got joy, joy, joy in my arms alright
Although you treat me badly, I love you madly
You really got a hold on me, you really got a hold on me


Never any call for a lone wolf
You have to learn to go with the flow
But they can find a use for a scarecrow
Depending on your stomach for crows

Always gonna need a little muscle
If you prove yourself worthy of trust
Your bones don't rust
Haven't checked a mirror in years
Don't need to know the bad news
There's not gonna be a gold watch
After thirty years of paying your dues

Show up five minutes early as usual
Work on just a couple hours' rest
Your bones don't rust

They stay hard as diamonds
They cut through steel
They still sing when they're hungry
And they ache when they're angry

Listen for the voice of the spirit
Maybe something wrong with your ears
Always on the edge of collapse now
Absolutely nobody cares

But everybody loves a professional
Not a single track in the dust
Your bones don't rust
You might also like
Your bones don't rust
Your bones don't rust


I saw the darkness coming down
It posed no threat to me
I let the darkness ease its way around
It was every good thing I'd expected it would be
I saw you coming through the twisting vines outside
I saw the new moon collide
With the stars
Clustered around her

I saw the young fruit on the new lime
I felt your breath catch its rhythm
I heard your legs push away the tall, dry brush
I saw the moon and the stars and knew the secrets within them
I heard you saying my name into my ear
No one has to tell me why you've come here
'Cause I know, I know
I know


The ushers and the guys who chuck the popcorn
They feel the rush of stillness in the air
They turn toward the ring from where they're standing
I'm just lying there
But I prop myself bolt upright on one hand
And I pull up on my haunches and I face the crowd
The guy who knocked me down has got his back turned
In comes the great grey pestilent cloud

I, I, I'm not gonna die in here
I, I, I'm not gonna die in here
Work hard to be a hero all my life
Always try to turn the other cheek
And save my closed-fist punches for the ones who throw them first
Always show some mercy to the wounded and the weak
Always help a guy back to his feet
Always help old ladies cross the street
I watch my guardian angel leave the building
I am my only friend
One thing about the good guys that I've noticed
They always beg for mercy in the end

And I, I, I'm not gonna die in here
I, I, I'm not gonna die in here
I, I, I'm not gonna die in here
I, I, I'm not gonna die in here


It takes a crowd to drown a witch"
So he said to us when he wriggled free and got the gun from me
Standing before us, his cracking voice rising in pitch
And then the blood that's been spilling from his eyes
Soaks through the bandages that are wrapped around his face
And just before he walks backwards through the wall
He pivots forty-five degrees to face us all
And he says, "Let him who has eyes to see
Take a good look at me
I'm a Mylar sheet hanging in the sun"
Claude Rains in all his glory is not arrayed like these
Who have come to walk before us, rising from their knees
Fighting back against their captors, calling down the curse
Like this man who's substance is malleable, screaming out chapter and verse
And then the blood that's been spilling from his eyes
Soaks through the bandages that are wrapped around his face
And just before he walks backwards through the wall
He pivots forty-five degrees to face us all
And he says "Let him who has eyes to see
Take a good look at me
I'm a Mylar sheet hanging in the sun"


The last of the repercussions died off real slow
The sky was still and the cold sun sank down beneath the snow
I hung by my hand from the tree outside
And I looked on the whole wide world

The voices came quietly, I shut them down
A tricky young southerly wind came at me with its high whistling sound
I turned around to face it with real arrogance burning inside
And I drank in the whole wide world


Sweeping out the shards
Do what I have to do
Try to start anew
But I thought of you twice
Couldn’t help myself
I don’t know what I need
Clutching and fingering the rosary beads
But I try, try, try, but I know (try, try, try, but I know)
I can’t let go
Try, try, try, but I know (try, try, try, but I know)
I can’t let go
TV upstairs
Leave it on all night
Do what I have to do
Add, subtract, and divide by 2
But my eyes light up
At cops and robbers time
I hope the bad guys win
I hope the good guys get their skulls bashed in
And I try, try, try, but I know (try, try, try, but I know)
I can’t let go
I can’t let go


I never get tired of this one

I've got a new life
You would hardly recognize me
I'm so glad
How could a person like me care for you?
Why should I bother when you're not the one?

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes I saw the sign
Love is demanding without understanding
Yeah I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
And no one's gonna drag you up
Under the pale moon
For so many years I've wondered who you are
How could a person like you bring me joy?
Under the pale moon where i see a lot of stars

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes I saw the sign
Love is demanding without understanding
Yeah I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
And no one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong

I saw the sign
(I saw the sign, I saw the sign)
And it opened up my eyes I saw the sign
(I saw the sign, I saw the sign)
Love is demanding without understanding
Yeah I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
And no one's gonna drag you up
Hey!


The water's real cool and the water's real sweet
Here's hoping that no points repeat
Because I bet against the chances that you'd ever be mine
Laid everything down on the don't pass line

And it's a stupid trick of fortune anyway
But the lights are bright tonight
And your eyes shine tonight on Chesapeake Bay
Walk through the water and our feet get wet
And on the dark ended water I see your silhouette
Five dollars says that it's gone in a minute
Five dollars says that your heart goes with it

It's a stupid trick of fortune anyway
But the lights are bright tonight
And your eyes shine tonight on Chesapeake Bay


It gets harder to keep trying to hold on
Watch our hopes take wing
Wave at them when they're gone
Plunge like suicides from rooftops
Break our ankles when we land
And bless the arrows
That strike us where we stand

If it doesn't crush me
It's alright
If it doesn't break me
It's alright
All the petty demons trying to break me in two
I was born stronger than any of you
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It gets complicated
When they come in for their counterattack
Everybody hates a victim
Who won't stop fighting back
Sprayed blood in their faces
Play for keeps
And bless the brave assassins
Who strike us while we sleep

If it doesn't crush me
It's alright
If it doesn't break me
It's alright
All the petty demons trying to break me in two
I was born stronger than any of you
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright


I meant to leave the house this morning
And begin making my way toward where you are
I meant to leave the house this morning
I made it halfway across the front yard

But the plum tree hung heavy in my head
And the plum tree hung heavy in my heart
And the plum tree hung heavy over me
So I tore off to the phone
To call you and tell you something, but I couldn't remember what
Because through the clean, clean windows
Saw the plum tree's leaves, as red as fresh blood

And the plum tree hung heavy in my head
And the plum tree hung heavy in my heart
And the plum tree hung heavy over me


We both know you're leaving
You just don't want to say it yet
'Cause you don't want to hurt my feelings
So you gnaw your little holes in the net

And you torture me with those big eyes
And you punish me with pity
But I'm going to Cleveland
You say you wanted to strike first
Because one of us was leaving, that's what you say
But I've always been real fond of you
So I never would have treated you this way

And you torture me with those big eyes
And you punish me with pity
But I'm going to Cleveland

I hear the Cuyahoga calling
Now I know what I was born for
And you say "Hey John, where are you going?"
But that's not my name anymore

And you torture me with those big eyes
And you punish me with pity
But I'm going to Cleveland


When I got home I meant to give you some sweet chrysanthemum
The wind chimes were ringing all wrong
And you were standing in the doorway singing along
And I tried to remember how nice it had been a long, long time ago
But I couldn't remember, I honestly could not remember

And a package came for you today from the Hunan Province
The postmark burning jet black in the summer sun
Someone was changing, someone was changing from the inside out
And I turned around to face you
Sweet peas in the garden were all in full bloom
And I thought I heard the traces of an old song murmuring in the room
Like a half-remembered conversation, but I let it fall away
And then I could not remember, and then I honestly could not remember

And a package came for you today from the Hunan Province
The postmark burning jet black in the summer sun
Someone was changing, someone was changing from the inside out
And I turned around to face you


Here inside the final diorama
Charting weather patterns for kicks
There're several fairly weighty problems
I'm pretty sure the simulation won't fix

Never any better at bottom
And the signals I'm set up to receive
Choking on the blood of the androids
Wiping off my mouth on my sleeve
Shining on the inside, maybe
Shining on the inside, maybe

Somewhere in the monument garden
Suggestions of a tunnel to freedom
Every hour, the crack of the rifle
Never any guns when you need them

I gotta test my chin on the concrete
It's the only way to be sure
Only the desperate ever make it to the exit
Only the brave and the pure

Shining on the inside, maybe
Shining on the inside, maybe

Shining like a deep sea creature
Only temporarily bearing the pressure

Sniffing at the walls of the maze
All the ancient rumors were true
You only see the jump cuts and the close-ups
You never get the aerial view
You might also like
Content to maybe serve as an example
Set up a sign or two on the trail
There's a lot of things that can happen
All for the want of a nail

Shining on the inside, maybe
Shining on the inside, maybe


We saw the last of the brightly-colored birds
Check out and make for the other world
And you asked me how much longer we'd have to stay here
But I'm not at liberty to say
And what flowers there were around Kingston
Were blue
I ripped them up from the dry soil
And draped them over you

We saw the last of the bright birds coming home
I saw you address them through your megaphone
And you asked me when we were leaving
Well, it's any day now
And what flowers there were around Trenchtown
Were red
I stole them from the hands of children
Braided them around your head


One, two, one, two, three, four…
Oh, you don't want to start like that, you want me to do the thing
That's not how we ever start

Well, you were standing in the door
Well, I wondered what you were waiting for
I saw the wild strawberries on the vine
Out of control
Well, I was trying to think of something clever
You were saying nothing whatsoever
I saw the berries throw their hooks into the soil
Felt the blood between us churning thick as motor oil

We come from California
The air around you was familiar to me now
You were gazing westward
I was looking at you again


When I see you in your new blue jeans
I know you're lying
And I know what it means
When I see you take your place among the poor
I know you're a fraud for sure

Bad priestess, bad priestess

So the sunlight plays its games along your eyes
And it has the same effect on a thousand other guys
And I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel the pull too
But the sunlight makes me strong and I know about you
Bad priestess, bad priestess

On a Thursday as the sun goes down
Bad priestess
With a super-special eyelash trick

Bad priestess, bad priestess


Rain all burned away
The horseflies are an iridescent green
Plums boiled down to pulp
Drying on a screen

Bright red air inside the house here
I can barely draw breath
Dark blue shapes pop behind my eyelids
I am not afraid of death
And on the television
Black and white footage of the young Cassius Clay
My god, my god, my god
He was something
Fists flashing as he comes toward the screen
Sailing headlong into nothing
And disappearing, reappearing
Out there in the clearing
Floating down the slight breeze
That plays along the edges of the leaves
It's you, it's you
It's you


On Venus it rains sulphuric acid
And the raindrops evaporate before they hit the ground
Japanese red-crowned cranes by the water here
Trouble in town

I feel like I'm gonna drown down here
It's all coming down down here

Hurricanes in from Australia
Tore up the neighborhood
A telegram from Lithuania
And the news is not good
And I don't speak the language down here
It's all coming down down here

Johnson Johnson is my name
Brooklyn is my station
Heaven is my resting place
God is my salvation


I looked you up and down
I liked everything I saw
From the fragile outline of your hips
To the trembling movements in your jaw
But then the coffee cup shattered on the kitchen floor
You said that you couldn't take it anymore
I knew you were leaving
I knew you were going to Bristol

I watched you pack your bags
Saw you head up to the door
But when the key broke off in the deadbolt lock
You said that you couldn't take it anymore
That was the second time you said that in one day
Why don't you just sit still, it's going to be OK
Going to Bristol, going to Bristol
Going to Bristol, going to Bristol


On the way home from the party
Neither of us said a word
Leann Rimes on the car stereo
Sang that song you know I hate, the one about the blackbird

And the rain came down on the windshield
I wished it would wash us both away
You had to open up your mouth, didn't you?
I knew what you were gonna say
And you were Bluebeard's wife
Opening every cupboard, trying to find the smoking gun
Well, I told you, I told you
I told you not to open that one


Alright: Shirtless in Hamburg

Sleep two to a bed;
Four to a room
Profits from the countryside
Glad tidings of doom
Too broke to play around
Like the soldiers do
All up and down
The glittering avenue
Anything's better than the future
I can see that from here

Stack the amplifiers high
Turn up the bass
Spring wild from the wings
With glitter on my young face
It's miserable outside
But in here it's warm
It always feels so stable
At the center of the storm
Snake on my chest for protection—
Why the hell not?


Stockpile of ammunition in wooden crates
Stenciled with exotic ports of call
White rags stuffing up glass jugs
Clean-burning over proof alcohol

I did not seek out the mission
But the mission found me
Twenty-one years old
I mean to learn what it's like to be free
We're gonna need
We're gonna need more bandages
We are gonna need
We're gonna need more bandages

Cheap overseas tobacco
Hidden treasures within
You can even smoke it if you're desperate
We do get desperate now and again

I am not the first to follow the plan
Just a cog in the machine
I'm just here to run interference
Dancing like a fly on the screen

We're gonna need
We're gonna need more bandages
We are gonna need
We're gonna need more bandages

More bandages, more shovels
When the shovels break
We've still got our fingernails
You might also like
Why wait until tomorrow?
Victory awaits with the dawn
If we all get blown to pieces
We can leave a nasty mark when we're gone

I did not hunt down the moment
It found me in a dream
Struck down as a warning to the others
Nothing without my brothers

We're gonna need
We're gonna need more bandages
We are gonna need
We're gonna need more bandages


The fog rolled in
And it’s never gonna lift, I guess
Breathe against the window facing the street
Scribble with my finger on the glass

Trying to read the horoscopes
Of animals long extinct
Trying to read the omens in the kitchen sink
The fog took shape
Like a golem with a vengeful eye
Limbs like rippling swans’ necks
At least a hundred stories high

Trying to read the horoscopes
Of animals long extinct
Trying to read the omens in the kitchen sink
Trying to force an ending
Where everything turns out well
Don’t really mind the ritual
Just the smell

Get word sometimes
From distant outposts much like mine
Places where the fog rolled in one day
Try to tell them it will work out fine

Trying to read the horoscopes
Of animals long extinct
Trying to read the omens in the kitchen sink


Get dizzy and angry searching for some source of light
Unknown alphabets in spray paint on the street
Seek out their source and find it and fall down at its feet
Get some aspirin powders to rub into my gums
Wait for the pain to hit me, buckle when it comes
Feel it drill in like a corkscrew
Avert my eyes when the cause comes into view
Feel the fear in my chest all day
Praise you anyway
Feel the fear in my chest all day
Praise you anyway
See the road rise to the summit up ahead
Remember an old friend with a pistol to his head
When it comes my time for the laying on of hands
Let me feel the blow when it lands
Look for the secrets half buried like trinkets in a field
Hope that the hidden things someday will be revealed
Stumble through the darkness can't see anything at all
Whimper like a whipped dog when I fall
Feel the fear in my chest all day
Praise you anyway
Feel the fear in my chest all day
Praise you anyway


That look in your eye
In the pinprick point where kindness goes to die
I'll be six years old next year
You erase me
You'll be sorry
You always feel sorry later on
When you come around to say so
I will be gone
And in my place meet my letter perfect body double
You erase me
When i got ready
To set out on my own
Took up the reigns myself all through you
Dug the spurs in clean down to the bone
But all that comes later
Now there's only you and me
And the replica where my body used to be
You can go ahead and hit him
He feels no pain at all
You erase me
You erase me


A warm wind
Dvorak on the short wave
Clear signal coming in
La la la
La la la la la la la
La la la
La la la la la la la
Long vowels spill like liquid from your mouth
I hang on every word you say
An army of transistor radios on the bookshelf
Left on all day
Let them play
Yeah, let them all play on and on and on
Let them all play longer and louder
And long after you're gone
La la la
La la la la la la la
La la la
La la la la la la la
Clear sky sheltering our fragile little house
Listening to the radio all the time
Your hand on my forehead as though to check for a fever
Yeah, big plans in mind
La la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la
La la la la la la la


Red, red, red everywhere
Bright red all along the thin canvas wall
I stepped outside for a little air
I stepped outside to get away from it all

I went out to the front and saw the purple sky
Making jokes about my condition

I am going for a walk
I'll be back in half an hour
Watch over the children
I'll be back in half an hour
Hey hey, lalala
Hey hey, lalala


The wax paper that I taped over the windows
Melted quick as chocolate in the heat
It'll probably never come off now
The windows look like frosted glass if you see them from the street
And the dim light that filters through
Casts a new light on you
It makes me get all misty because I remember something
And then I see a shadow

And I, I-I-I wanna follow you all the way down this time
I want to see what it is you're going down for
I, I-I-I want you more than I want anything
I want you the way you were
You were lying in the moonlight
Outside in the grass
When I heard an animal voice somewhere in the dark
And I saw a wing shadow pass
And just then the gleam in your eye
Made my blood freeze
There was something up above us
Rustling in the branches of the trees

And I, I-I-I pressed up against you again
I could hear your heartbeat, steady and hard and pure
I used to love you so much that I was sure it would kill me
And I want you the way you were



I bet you don't know

I cut down that withered peach tree
Just like you asked me to
And I hacked it into pieces
Set it on fire with your face in plain view
At the near window where you stood
Watching me split the wood
I will do as I am told
I will keep away the cold
The fire pit in the snow
Gave off a rich, bright, orange-red glow
A familiar scent rose up into the air
And I remembered something special from a long time ago
You opened up the door
Stepped away from the killing floor
Your footprint on the snow is fresh and new
When you touched me I felt fire coming through

I will do as I am told
I will keep away the cold
I will do as I am told
I will keep away the cold


You looked real calm as we made our way up the walk
There were lazy kisses and hands brushing and small talk
The moon was high, your smooth face was high
And the kudzu grew

And the stars fell on Alabama
And your eyes filled up with light
And the stars fell on Alabama
The warm earth underneath us gave way
Dry grass crinkled like paper as the breeze came in across the bay
Cold clean water nearby glimmered in your eyes
And your pistol glistened

And the stars fell on Alabama
And your eyes filled up with light
And the stars fell on Alabama

But if you think I'll take a bullet for you, you're dreaming


Sure as a surgeon
You slipped your hand into the door jamb
Blood coursing through the air tonight
I know who I am
And I know who you are
Or who you were just an hour ago
Static interference on the radio tonight
I know what I know

Quick as lightning
You brought your hand back inside
And you shut the door behind you
It's too hot out there tonight
Breath rising and falling
Expansion, contraction
Why'd you tell me this?
Were you looking for my reaction?



You bought me a rabbit to keep me company
And I'm here in my car and the rabbit's here with me
Heading out highway one, respecting posted speed limits
And I tried to figure this one out but I can't find any meaning

And I'm sick and tired of trying to figure out your gestures
And I'm sick and tired of wondering what your presents mean
I'm gonna take this rabbit into Malibu
And he'll chew on sour grass while I wolf down dexadrine
Dexadrine
The wind comes through the open window and I button my shirt
And the rabbit's riding shotgun, my teeth hurt
You sent me a package marked "live animals inside"
And the sun's coming up quickly above the rising tide

And I'm sick and tired of trying to figure out your gestures
And I'm sick and tired of wondering what your presents mean
I'm gonna take this rabbit into Malibu
And he'll chew on sour grass while I wolf down dexedrine
Dexedrine



Deep is the midnight sea
Warm is the fragrant night
Sweet are your lips to me
Soft as the moon and sand
Oh, when shall we meet again?
When the night has left us, will the spell remain?

(Waves)
The waves invade the shore
(We)
Though we may kiss no more
(Night)
Night is at our command
(Moon)
Moon and sand

(Waves)
The waves invade the shore
(We)
Though we may kiss no more
(Night)
Night is at our command
(Moon)
Moon and sand



From the front door to the drug store
From the drug store to the bakery
From the loading dock to the chimes of the city clock
They're about to make their play for me

But I will rise, I will rise
'Cause I got guys
Guys on every corner
With your tabloid stars and your unmarked cars
With your special forces and your inside sources
With your radar fields and your riot shields
And heavy horses

I'm coming to swat you down like flies
'Cause I got guys
Guys on every corner

They don't look so special
T-shirts and tennis shoes, blank exprssions
A couple of Chicago guys
A robust East Bay delegation

From th far ends of the earth they have loosely gathered
To stand in doorways making small talk about the weather
They look like nothing, they look like your neighbors
You won't remember their faces later

Run like rats
Look to the skies
'Cause I got guys
Guys on every corner


As they age, men encounter the sixth fear: loss of virility. Just look him straight in the eye, invade his space by standing a little closer than normal
{Waves}

By eight-thirty AM the sun was so hot
That it made me remember
And I pulled on the jacket with the bars on the pocket
And I stood in front of the window
And the skin on my face has a memory all its own
And it drinks in the pure heat, real slow
I remember Lima
I remember the good life
I remember Lima
I remember the good life

And the window is ten feet high and three feet wide
Sunbeams bounce off the dark water
And come through the clear glass, magnified
Standing here in the house on Pacific Coast Highway
Given to me by a friend whose name is no longer important
My conscience is clean
And the feeling of power like thick red wine
And it's oh-nine-oh-five, military time

I remember Lima
I remember the good life
I remember Lima
I remember the good life
I remember Lima
I remember the good life
I remember Lima
I remember the good life


Toward the end of our first year in Las Vegas
You looked up from your little corner
And I saw that your face was getting a little brighter
And you asked me is it really getting warmer
Or is it just me?
And then you started mumbling unintelligibly
So what are you saying anyway

I thought I heard bells ringing
But then I remembered that I no longer knew what bells sounded like
I thought we'd maybe strike up a conversation
Til bad luck cruised by on his ten-speed bike
I got real cold and I grabbed my coat
And I saw that the ringing was coming from your throat
What are you saying anyway


Peppers on the plants
Plum tomatoes ripening on the vine
Midsummer evenings on the back porch
Barbecued sweet corn, sweet white wine

When the west wind comes through
It'll rip right through you
When the west wind comes through
It'll rip right through you
Bottle after bottle of the cheap stuff
Feeling two degrees north of all right
Heaven help us, heaven help us
We're all gonna die tonight

When the west wind comes through
It'll rip right through you
When the west wind comes through
It'll rip right through you

Party goes on 'til the end of August
The tensions build, the air currents throb
Mosquitos suck the blood right out of my body
Why don't they finish the job

When the west wind comes through
It'll rip right through you
When the west wind comes through
It'll rip right through you


We all woke up that morning
Claw marks on our little faces
The dull thud from the treetops
The echo in the hollow places
Rose up high and lonely
Wringing my hands, grinding my teeth
All the triumph overhead
All the disaster underneath

Spat out my morning prayers
Desperate pleas and viscious lies
Felt the sunlight through the grating
Covered up my eyes
Woke up feeling awful
Shook my head to drive the ghosts away
This is just a flesh wound
And it will clear up any day
But the present i got planned for you pricks
Is gonna be a little harder to fix
Thank god
For small favors
In high doses

Heard the voices through the air vents
Listen to them squeal
The great big world is out there
The hidden one beneath my heel
Called up my sister in Reseda
Left a message at the tone
All the points where contact fails us
All of the dead spots in the zone

And the acid in my throat
Every time i try to talk
The songs that keep me up at night
Standing on that solid rock
Rose up high and dry and lonely
Stumbled coming out the gate
This is just a paper cut
And it will scab over just you wait
But the cuts that i'll shortly being dealing out
Are gonna give you something to cry about
You might also like
Thank god
For small favors
In high doses


Huffed some cans of spray paint and began to vomit blood
One more night in this town's gonna break me, I just know
Hang on to your dreams 'til someone makes you let them go
Stumbled on down Indian Hill, tail between my legs
Sick taste in my mouth, Folgers Crystals and hard boiled eggs
If I can't run away tonight, I don't know what I'll do
Hang on to your dreams 'til someone beats them out of you
Do what you have to do, go where you have to go
When the time comes to loosen up your grip, you'll know
Called my friend in New York, three thousand miles away
Halfway through her metamorphosis, nothing I could say
Hoard my small resentments like rare and priceless gems
Hang on to your dreams until there's nothing left of them
